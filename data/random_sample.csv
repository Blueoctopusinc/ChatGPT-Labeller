I looked up at the night sky and noticed between 30 to 40 rectangular objects moving west to east. They appeared to be very far away. 

I noticed there were four colours present, red, green, yellow and blue. These coulours were in random order. The objects appeared in three rows. Under the third row was one single yellow rectangular light, larger and longer than the rest. This light appeared to be trying to catch up to the front of the leading crafts and slowed as it approached the front of the formation. 

After approx 30 seconds all of the lights dimmed into nothing.

I was sitting at a small park on the edge of Lake Jackson, looking up at the blue sky and few clouds and noticing the floaters in my aging eyesight when I saw a star. Thought that was pretty neat as I don't often see stars until nearer to dusk. I realized it was moving - almost imperceptively - but moving all the same. I was intrigued and turned on my car to see the time. 7:26 pm. I watched for another 20 minutes and watched this ""star"" move about 30 degrees to the north and east, almost straight above me. Called my husband who drove his car to my location. He saw it, said cool, and started investigating the grounds. He would check in with me every 5 minutes to see where it had moved. Intensity of the light never really changed and the movement was so slight that you wouldn't notice it moving unless you were keeping track of it. When initially seen, I was looking SSW. Over the 90 minutes it was visible, it moved over a portion of the sky that a place mat would cover if held at arms length. During the sighting a few high flying jets went over. I couldn't tell whether the light was at a higher or lower altitude than these jets but my feeling was it was in the upper atmosphere. I called my sister and brother in law who live a few miles away and they both saw the 'star' from their location but were uninterested in it moving. At about 8:50 pm it was located further west than when first seen and it just winked out - I believe due to the setting sun. Made me realize the 'star' was not giving off its own light, but was reflecting light. During the show, I also called my nephew who works for JPL in Pasadena, but couldn't reach him. He called me later and said it could be a weather balloon, a spy plane, or some rocket that shoots straight up then unloads its cargo and comes right back down. None of those sounded right to me, but who knows? I didn't have a camera or binoculars and didn't think to ask my husband to bring them. I tried taking cell phone pic but of course nothing showed up. It was a great 24th anniversary present. Curious if anyone else saw this?",US,

It was about 9:30 PM. I was alone at home, reading a book in my bedroom. My kids slept in their bedroom in the basement. The lights were all off, except my reading light on my headboard.

I was focused on my book when I saw something from the corner of the eye. I immediately felt chills. Looking, I saw that there was nothing. So I continued my reading for a few minutes until a flash of white light lighted my whole bedroom. Then I saw three white spheres the size of a basketball floating in the air at the height of the ceiling. I felt terrified. The spheres move synchronously in spirals around the room. Spheres of light emitted a hum. Spheres illuminated the room. With a yank, the spheres have stopped moving and vanished.

My heart was beating too fast. I looked at my phone and it was 10:34 PM. Reassured, I told myself that I had probably dreamed of this observation.

I instinctively looked out the window. What I saw completely hurt me. There was a total of two beings standing, looking at me through my window. They were about 4 feet tall, big heads, big slanted black eyes, no nose, only nostrils. They looked at me with a terrible stare. I could feel anger towards me. I was sweating cold water. I was terrified. 

Suddenly, they disappeared in a matter of seconds. I felt reassured for a second, until something cold grabbed my legs and my arms at the same time. I couldn't move, they were holding me tight. I could feel something cold inside my skull, as if someone was touching parts of my brain. It was a really scaring experience. A really uncomfortable feeling. Everything went black and I passed out.

I woke up next morning at 09h52, with a terrible headache. Something happened last night. I will never be the same again.

Listed on the January
1951 BB sighting index as ""Case Missing"", and a meager
description from the UFO Evidence, I posted this case
on Tuesday, 2 Oct, 2012. To the rescue came Brad
Sparks, Dan Wilson, and Mike Swords. In an unprocessed
email in September, Dan had found (16) documents and
advised that ""the case was misfiled as 1952. This is
the reason for the 'Case Missing'"". All this was
called to my attention when Brad advised the same
information with detail, providing too the above
detailed entry from his catalog.Â Then Mike sent
(7) documents and even more detail. Thanks to these
great A-Team members we have the missing information
on this case.

Mike Swords:
One key thing that researchers/readers should note
here is that this was a General Mills case at the time
when the GMills guys were really angry with Grudge and
so was the Navy shortly thereafter. So the GM guys
didn't report the 1951 case until about a year later,
and then only to a CIA guy who was reporting it to the
Navy's newly formed UFO case collection project. The
head of that project ultimately decided to share
information with Blue Book [Ruppelt had gotten in by
that time and was probably viewed as a better guy, and
Ruppelt misunderstood the case date initially,
reporting it in BB#6 as 1952. He later learned [too
late] that it actually was 1951 and corrects that in
his book. This 1952 error gets into the UFO community
and persists. By the 1960s however it is corrected and
we have the 1951 date since then.

My wife and I were sitting on our front porch around midnight. We live out in the country and did not have any of our outside lights on--we like to look at the stars. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, my wife said, ""Is that a helicopter or plane?"" I looked where she was pointing and saw what appeared to be the lights (red blinking and solid white) of a helicopter or plane just above the tree line. The lights were far enough apart for me to believe it was a helicopter less than a mile away. But we should have been able to hear it...so at this point I was thinking it was a plane further away. But then things became bizzare; the white solid light began moving away from the blinking red light at a very rapid rate of speed--at least twice as fast. So at this point I was thinking it couldn't be a plane further away because the other light couldn't possibly move that fast. So at this point I was thinking it was a closer helicopter again chasing some smaller object with the solid white light. But if it were closer, why couldn't we hear anything? We watched as the white light was far enough away to disappear behind the tree line and then a minute later the helicopter disappeared behind the tree line too. We first saw it when it was basically directly in from of us to the North and watched as both lights headed East in a straight line and disappeared within one minute.

I do not know what it was that we saw, but being the rational person I am it must have been the airforce testing some small aircraft and following it with another plane. They were heading toward Fort Campbell which is about a 45 minute drive from our house.",US,

My Dad and I were out in the woods deer hunting and when it got too dark to hunt, my Dad walked over to my blind to get me. Just after we left my blind at about 5:55 that evening, our attentions were drawn to some lights up in the sky. There were no clouds and no wind that evening and it was still light enough out, that you couldn't see any stars yet, nor did you need a flash light to see where you were going. My Dad and I saw them at the same time. They weren't that far up into the sky; maybe a 1000 feet or less. The larger object was the shape of a pipe (but of course, much larger) with a bright light at each end of it. They seemed to be as bright and as large as head lights would be on a car. The other object was sightly lower and to the left of the larger object and it was just a light. Neither of them made any sound and they just hovered in one spot; we never saw them move. My Dad then drew up his gun to look at them through his scope. When he did this, they slowly dimmed their lights and disapeared, vanishing, without ever moving! It was as if they were watching us. As light as it still was out there, we should have been able to see the outline of the objects, in the air, but they were gone. I was shaking soo hard after we saw them, I had a hard time walking out. Note: Earlier that evening, we heard military jets flying around the area. I don't ever recall hearing them fly around there in the 16 years I've hunted there. Do you think they were looking for something?

TIME: 5:19 pm, U.S. east coast time, still daylight out, sun was above the treetops. LOCATION: Charlotte County (northern southwest Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico). EVENT: I was outside my home, returning from my mailbox and spotted a contrail in progress above my location. There were other contrails in the sky nearer the horizon, some criss-crossing. With the unaided eye, the size of the contrail was about half the width of a pencil at arm's length, with an elongated object about half the size of a pencil tip traveling in front of it. What was unusual was that the object was displaying a single reddish-orange glow or light along its length. I rushed and got a pair of binoculars and observed that the object appeared to be a conventional looking passenger or cargo jet, except for one big difference: its fuselage, at least the underside portion observable to me on the ground, was glowing or radiating a uniform bright reddish-orange color (not a point of light, but the entire length of the fuselage). The wings were normal in appearance, not glowing or lighted, and appeared, from the great distance, to be white, tan, or gray. Two contrails were forming a short distance behind the aircraft, which then combined into a single contrail (a normal occurrence). The aircraft was traveling southward along the Gulf Coast of Florida, yet slightly inland. The nearest international airport it could have flown out of is in Sarasota, and then north of that, in Tampa, where there is also a major headquarters-status U.S. Air Force base (the Gulf War was managed from there). Since the sun was still above the treetops and there was no evidence of any sunset activity in the sky (even if there was, the aircraft would have needed a mirrored fuselage to reflect the level of light seen), I lowered my binoculars and rushed inside the open side door to my garage to get a video camera I keep on a shelf and back outside. I timed it after the event and my eyes were off the aircraft only 8 seconds. When I looked back up in the sky, all I saw was the contrail cut off in its tracks where I had seen it last and no aircraft. I searched with my binoculars and couldn't locate any evidence of it, which should have still been visible. I wish now I had kept observing the jet with the binoculars for those 8 seconds. Was what I saw an exotic new U.S. stealth aircraft fitted with a skin of light panels that could allow it to blend into the sky upon activation, or is there a conventional explanation? I don't know. All I can do is report what I observed. I've witnessed one other definitely exotic stealth aircraft earlier in my life, totally different than this incident, but some things need and deserve continued secrecy.

I was reclining in my lawn chair at aprox 22:24, when directly overhead, traveling straight north, I saw 4-5 shapes, resembling large stars, amber in color, flying in formation, pass directly overhead. These objects traveled in a ""V"" formation, were silent, seemed to be about 200 feet off the ground, and they appeared to be within 5 - 10 feet of each other. my home is very close to an Air Force Base, and also sits directly under the flight path of incoming and outgoing commercial aircraft going to and from Salt Lake Int'l Airport. At the same time I saw this anomaly, there were commercial flights in the area. Judging by the speed of these commercial jets, it appeared that the items I saw were traveling at approximately the same speed as does a commercial jet, but much slower than an F-16. It was a calm night, little to no cloud cover, a light breeze, and the stars in the sky were clearly visible. The object(s) were travelling so quickly and at such a low altitude, that I lost sight of them within a very short time. The objects never changed color, shape, speed or direction. But since they were traveling in unison or formation, it certainly appeared to me that they were flying under intelligent control.",US,

So I am used to waking up early for work even on days off and I often go to grab a breakfast item from the near by fast food spot. The first morning as I was pulling into my block I saw two objects..white lights appearing to be a star or satellite or a plane at the time.....so I drove out behind my house into the dark desert as I am located on the very edge of town...parked and got out to watch these objects.  One stayed on a steady path moving as a satellite or plane would. ""I am sure it was not a plane as there were no flashing lights and I am accustomed to seeing air planes in las vegas"" and the second object appeared to fade away as if it was rapidly moving up into space. The first object that was identical was still moving on the original path moving southwest to north or northwest toward Creech AFB of possibly A51.  After thinking that sighing was not an airplane since it had no flashing lights and since the sun was not up I was doubtful on a satellite theory I decided to venture out to see if I saw anything this morning at the same time... to my surprise there it was again..at the same time. 5:30 am or so... moving over what seems to be the mountain range between Pahrump and Las Vegas. This object was the same in description..only one this time and it stayed on a steady path moving SW to NW I believe.

I will continue to watch for this daily as I believe it is either a Military UFO or the Tall Whites out at Indian Springs ""Creech AFB"" doing their nightly running around.
 Funny I never see any planes along this flight path..only these objects.",US,

Later in the afternoon, me and my buddy was outside his house waiting at his car for my dad to come pick us up. We were talking and I looked up in the sky and I saw an airplane. The weird thing was that there was another flying object flying perfectly right beside the airplane. I mean it was going at the same exact speed that the airplane was, without moving or turning or anything. The unknown object beside the airplane looked as though it was larger than the airplane and it had a very bright glow to it. But the oddest thing about the object was that, unlike the airplane, it looked as though it was floating through the air and there was no smoke cloud left behind it like all flying aircrafts make when theyre being flown. Which leads me to believe that this was a supernatural occurence and that it was a UFO. After about 4 or 5 minutes the object and the airplane got so far away that they werent visible to us any longer. I wonder if anyone in that plane saw anything during their flight and if their were any reports? It was so high up, I couldnt tell what shape it was.

Okay. I can't believe I'm going to do this. Here goes.

I have been witnessing since 2014. Mostly orbs, ""stars"", sparklers, weird lights in general. Only once have I seen a solid craft.

I felt compelled to report because I saw something almost exactly like the recent events at Bowling Green and Round Rock. I saw a line of what I might have dismissed as satellites, but they were in the wrong place. I stopped counting at some point. They all appeared out if thin air at a certain point Southwest of Venus. One after the other they followed the same trajectory and disappeared into nothing after maybe a length of 10-15 degrees(? I can't think of a more objective way to describe the distance).

They weirdest part is that they all flashed at the midway point in their journey. It built up then diminished, not instant like a camera. All at the same spot, just after passing beneath Venus. Only one of the objects fucked up. And there was a brief pause at some point. I easily saw over 40 crafts in the span of ten minutes. I've seen a lot of wild stuff, but nothing like this before.

Initially the object appears as soon as the skies are dark, about 9:00 P.M. in Indianapolis. It appears to be a bright star in thw western sky, about 40 degrees above the horizon It has been observed every night for about 2 weeks, except when skies overcast.The amazing thing is that as you watch it the light begins to move, drifting from side to side over about 45 degrees left or right. some times slowly, sometimes dashing across the sky, sometimes moving up in the sky until almost overhead, then drifting or darting back to its original area of the sky.

During all these maneuvers the object appears to be a bright spot of light, sometimes with a faint red corona. It's most amazing behavior is its transformation into a brightly colored little carnival badge, with what look like neon tubes emanating from its perimeter.

At its brightest it seems to have gaudy feathers on it top, abd shafts if red kigyht where legs would be. lights twinkle brightly, and the object moves slowly around as if parading its splendor. Then it turns back into a bright light and zooms around some more.My neighbors and I have observed fdor 8 or 9 nights amd I believe it is visible all night.

While i was watching them and attempting to figure out what they could be, the began moving from their triangle formation to being seemingly stacked in front of one another from my angle, and then they slowly spread out again, a second or two later one split off while the other two kept moving in the same direction, and then the other floated back to where the two where, after which they began to fly in a straight line for a few seconds.

I was sitting in my living room watching tv. I had just sat down when i saw something out of the corner of my eye from the window. I jumped off the couch and looked out the window.

It was huge though and it was fast. It flew over my house exstreamly quickly. Way quicker than any plane I have ever seen and with my father being retiered Air Force i knew my planes. I also knew that there is no planes or jets that regularly fly over my house. I am not a scientist so I cannot determine the hight or exact speed or size it was but i know it was huge and fast.

i saw a plane passing by the noise made me look up and then i saw the object(s).
i honestly been seeing strange lights and movements the past couple of days so at first i thought maybe its a far away plane. 
the object was hovering as two other went by it seemed as if the 1st object had stopped while thee other two passed by them not to far apart from one another.
than suddenly looked as if it took off in the same direction the other two objects in a wobble or spinning like motion but at a faster really faster rate!
the past few days ive been seen strange objects in the city skies ,on may 6th 12 about 2am-ish ive seen wat at first i thought was star but the movements convinced me it was a star.it was pulsin and had another which seems to be circling it like orbiting..this was another reason that had me constantly looking up now.so when i spotted this one i just knew and felt a sense of unexplainability in me,sorry! all i can do was pull out my phone and got to snap about four pictures i try to get one as close as possible but really blurry. i would like some feedback i would like to know if i am right or wrong? plane? or UfO? i watched it until they were all gone the 1st two seem to just passed right by kind of back to back and the third one hovereed thats the one i actually got a picture of! then after about 2 minutes it took off in a vertical motion. im 98% sure that was not air regular airplane.

I was outside in my side yard looking West when from my left (South) I observed what appeared to be a fireball entering from high in the South. It traveled North North West. It was approximately 3 times brighter than Jupiter (which was up) and very bright white yellow orange and had a slight tail pointing South. 

I instantly thought fireball, but the object was slowing down, so I instantly thought this object was space junk. 

This object was ""dropping"" what appeared to be hot material that was same color as the object. The object continued to slow down and dripped the strange material two times on its trajectory before the object slowed to a complete static stop. I was baffled to say the least. 

As the object remained stationary, it dripped the bright material momentarily. The flight time from when I saw the object to when it came to a complete static stop was approximately 10 seconds - which is far too long of a time for any fireball or space junk, which I've witnessed countless times. I observed this object stationary for approximately 2 minutes in absolute amazement. 

I had my iPhone in my hand and shot one still photo of the object prior to it coming to a complete stop and I shot video as well. All you can see is a small dot due to iPhone camera not suited for shooting in dark. It also showed up on the video. 

While observing the object stationary for approximately 2 minutes I decided to take a chance a run in the house a grab a real camera, which only took about 2 minutes to retrieve, when I went back outside it was gone and I have no idea what happened to it. 

I've been a dedicated amateur astronomer for over 40 years and I know the sky well. Also visible were commercial jetliners in the sky in the same general area of the sky. This was neither a fireball or space junk - they don't slow down and come to a complete stop in the sk! y as this object did. It was not the Moon, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not Jupiter, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not Mars, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not a satellite. It was not the ISS. 

I'm hoping that others observed this object and will make reports.

We were driving east along the 118 Freeway, and to our right were the Santa Susana Mountains where Rockedyne is also located. I was the passengers seat and felt the need to scan the mountain tops with my eyes. All of a sudden i saw a bright light and told the driver to look at it. H elooked and said, ""yeah its bright, its probably the top of a tower."" As we kept driving towards the mountains I kept watching it and it was getting closer and brighter. As it got closer I could see two balls of light side by side. Then it began coming closer till it was right above us. I opened the sun roof and we pulled the car over to the side of the freeway so we could stop and watch it. It was directly over head and it was in a triangle shape. There were two white balls of light in front, and behind those two but alittle closer together were two slightly smaller balls of light. It was still quite light outside, and despite the size of these balls of light, i could see no craft that would be connecting the lights.

My window in my bedroom faces to the south. At around 11:45 on the evening of January 4th, 2007, I was just laying down for bed. I happened to look out the window and spotted something that wasn't quite right. My initial thought was that it was an airplane over McChord AFB. We have constant overhead flights from the base. After watching this object move slowly in a southeast direction towards or over McChord AFB I realized that it was not a normal craft. This is what it looked like.

Since it was dark and overcast I was not able to discern an actual outline. The object was probably 7 or more miles away on the horizon but it was pretty good size. There were dozens of white lights that were constantly flashing (twinkling) in rapid and non-uniform fashion. It almost appeared like the lights were moving rapidly in a circular motion but I cannot say for sure. All of the lights were white. Every aircraft I have watched fly anywhere in the area would have no more than 7 or 8 lights (multi-colored) on it at any time and if they flashed it was in a constant rhythm.

I watched this craft come to a stop and hover for about 30 seconds when every light shut off completely and it appeared to disappear. I figured then that it was just something that could probably be easily explained and was turning to go back to bed. After about 15 seconds of darkness the lights came back in the same position and the craft started to slowly move off in a southwesterly direction towards Ft. Lewis. This lasted for about a minute when it sped off and winked out.

About 6-7 years ago I was sitting in my back yard inphoenix Arizona Paradise Valley area some where around 10 pm. I was facing east when observed an object very low in the sky hovering at the tips of a cluster of pine trees a few neighborhoods over. I sat and watched it with interest thinking that someone had a remote control blimp because it was low and slow and seemed to be hovering. I watched and watched when I noticed it started to fly in my direction still quite always away.the further it got away from where I first noticed it I began to think wow they have a great range on their remote. As it was getting closer I kept trying to look for wing lights to c if it was in deed a plane.the lights kept changing and I couldn't decided the color I kept talking to my self out loud saying the colors I thought I could see yet never was able to distinguishe the color. Soon it was entering my yard about 15 -20 feet off the ground.I shouted for my cousin to come out because at that time I realize it wasn't a remote control blimp.it passed over our heads slightly to the right and hovered over my neibors house at the height of about 9-10 feet. It was very small about 4 ft. Disk shaped sourounded by windows and there appeared to b a cock pit that was illuminated. At that point we both got really scared and ran inside. I remember when it was right over my head it emitted a low soft whooshing sound. About 15 min. Later we gained our composer and went back to look but it was gone.

1. I was on my back porch enjoying the sunshine and blue clear sky.

2. I looked up over my left shoulder, at the treeline just as I was entering the house. I don't know what spurred me to do so. That is when I noticed the bright cylinder.

3. My first thought was a commercial jet. Many flights a day cross over my location to and from IAD and DCA airports. But it was in the wrong location, had no wings, and was stationary.

4. This object was bright silver, cylinder or cigar-shaped, and from my perspective vertical. The wind was very slightly ruffling the trees, from the NW, but if this object moved at all it was only very slight, and to the N. Through my binoculars, I saw it had two dark perfect circles, one at either end. Those dark spots illuminated, like at mag-lite flash light for 1-2 secs, then dimmed again, staying dark for 10-15 secs, then brightening. I saw this cycle 3 times.

5. When I first realized it wasnt a plane, I felt a little quesy, anxious maybe. I immediately went through a mental list of what it could be: satellite, space station, mylar balloon, etc. But I ruled the 1st 2 out as being too far away, and the last because it seemed to me it would have been drifting toward me and would have changed shape as it did so.

I then dashed inside for my camera. (crappy Kodak EasyShare C143 12 MP)
I zoomed in a tried to steady myself and snapped a shot. I realized I needed a tripod. Staring at the object I debated, then ran inside again to retrieve my tripod from the closet. Fumbling, I got set up, and was thankful to still see the object. I took 3 more still shots, and 2 videos. 

This whole while (approx 4-5 minutes) I was trying to judge the distance. My best guess is that it was 2000-5000 in altitude and maybe 1/2 mile to my north, about 50-60 degrees above the horizon.

It was still there, so I ran inside for my binoculars. I was stunned to see that is was perfectly symmetrical, rounded at both ends, dimensionally 1 unit in diameter by maybe 5-6 units in length, with 2 dark spots at either end. Those dark spots turned out to be lights. They pulsed on for a second or two, then dimmed dark. Not on and off like a light switch. The light seemed of the palest white-yellow.

I then went back to the camera to make another video, wishing I could zoom in more, but when I looked back up, the object was gone. I unhooked my camera and ran around the house to the front to try to relocate it, without success. Then I came inside to upload my photos and video. After checking them I was disappointed, because there is only the faintest spot. I then looked at the images in MS Paint, and was happy to see the cigar shape, after zooming in.
I did not alter, crop, resize anything. The files attached are in original condition. The object will be found in the lower left corner of the photos and video just above the trees, and to the right of the tip of the highest oak leaves on the left side of the images. Its very small, but it is there--it looks like a pale translucent white orb until you zoom in. In the video, you can see the sun glint on the object at 31-33 seconds, and at 54-56 seconds.)

I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city. On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far. I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings. It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near. This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it really caught my attention. I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise. I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining on the mountains, like a spotlight, and moving low towards the ocean. It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area. The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke. This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before. The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been. A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky. this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all. Within seconds it was ""parked"" next to a star, very far away.. It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself next to that star. Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually revolving. From the distance where I was I could see the object and I could tell that it was revolving with a red light.. A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared. That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO. I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind. The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.

Since I was driving, I could not get a clear uninterrupted look for more than a few seconds - but I kept looking up trying to determine if they were aircraft, hot air balloons, etc.

As I continued driving, I lost view of the diamond formation group of lights, but then saw a lower orange- red light that seemed to be moving across the sky at a steady pace with no blinking lights.

Now I have seen many objects in the night sky that I could easily explain such as Meteors, planets, artificiall satellites, airplanes, etc.. But this object did not 'act' like any of these. It was moving side to side as it descended, reminding me of a falling feather. As it descended it also seemed to be loosing some brightness but basically dissapeared very unexpectedly.

April 24, 2004, in Marietta, Georgia, was a beautiful, sunny, spring day. 

At about 4:30pm, I was lying on my bed, just looking up through my bedroom window (which has no blinds or shades), at the clear blue sky and a few puffy white clouds. All of a sudden, I noticed TWO PINK TRIANGLES way up in the clouds. I could not judge the distance, but it was very high...high enough for airplanes to fly, as I have seen many times before...but I knew these were not airplanes! 

Continuing to watch the TWO PINK TRIANGLES as they moved in close proximity to each other...I was trying to figure out what they were. I knew that they were not balloons...as they did not move with the wind...nor were they kites...which could easily be blown about as well. These either stayed stationary, or they moved in unison to the left, then right, and then up. Finally, they disappeared into the clouds.

Immediately phoning my cousin in Darlington, PA to report what I had just witnessed, a short time later while still on the phone, I was astonished to see the TWO PINK TRIANGLES reappear in the sky. I observed them again, for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again.

Having seen many programs on TV about UFO's, I knew that what I observed were very unusual. Never before had I heard of a UFO described as a PINK TRIANGLE. But I knew what I had seen was NOT an airplane, balloon, kite, or anything else I have ever seen before. I felt in my gut that what I had seen was very definitely a UFO! 

I am a Doctor of Chiropractic and I live and practice in Marietta, GA. I have no history of hallucinations, nor of seeing UFO's. My professional education has taught me to make objective observations of scientific evidence, and not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in. However, I am quite convinced that what I observed on April 24, 2004 were, in fact, TWO PINK TRIANGLES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN UFO's.

some 300 meters. Just before the observation these
specialists measured the level of radiation in the

On 5/5/11 at 2305 from a position of approximately 43.82 N 96.71 W looking due south, 180, I saw a brillant white light. I inititally only saw one because of a tree line so I thought it was just a satellite. I took a few steps to the side and that's when I saw all three brillant white lights in a perfect triangle formation. As I was looking due south, they were moving across the sky on a heading of about 030. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, one, I've never seen three satellites in such a formation, two, I've never seen a satellite so brillantly bright, let alone three in such a formation. The lead point on the triangle stopped and the other two lights caught up and also stopped forming a perfect line. They hovered there for about 30 seconds and then the lights went out completely. About two seconds after that two, red, chevron shaped craft in near perfect formation entered heading approximately 220.

There was zero commercial, general aviation, or military aircraft around at the time, not a single port or starboard light, no anti-collision lights, just the event that occured. The wind was light and variable at the time, visibility unlimited, and I did not hear any sound, the altitude they were at had to easily be above 40,000 feet (FL400). I've seen countless meteors, during the summer, my kids and I lay outside on the grass and watch.

This was either 1976 or 1977, I can't remember exactly, I was quite young at the time.

It was our annual neighborhood 4th of July party at the end of the dead end street. A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane. I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet. I don't really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure. When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft. It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered! Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect). It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom. The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember. It was close. I'm not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily. The most amazing thing was its departure. This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old. It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it. I have never seen or heard of any mechanical thing moving this fast in my life ever since I saw that.

I just got back from my fishing season and was staying at my friends place. It was evening time and my friend and I just got back from the store, the house is located on the bay and is a two story building. As I was walking through the living room I noticed an extremely bright white light outside over the bay, at first I thought it was a reflection on the big bay windows but it seemed strange so I walked up to the window and cupped my hands on the window. It was then that I knew whatever I was looking at wasn't a reflection, star, or moon. It was absolutely unmistakable for anything else. This craft was hovering about 5 or 600 ft off the water, it looked like a perfect circle and just sitting there, it was the brightest pure white I'v ever seen but not hard to look at, not like looking into the sun. As it just sat there a few moments and just as I was saying to myself, ""what is this thing"" it darted about 300ft to my left headed in a southwest direction, then stopped staying at an altitude of about 500ft. Then again shot strait towards the water back into the bay at a 45 degree angle right into the water, or so it seemed, it was just gone, no noise, splash, nothing that I could hear but I was inside. Every time it ""jumped"" or darted it left a tracer behind it sort of like if you wave a glow stick real fast at night it will leave streaks. I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed and ran over and got my friends from the other room telling them what I just saw but what I was surprised to hear is that right before we got back from the store my friends girlfriend said that she thought she had seen something darting around over the bay but when she approached the window she saw nothing. The craft was at least in the area for 20 minutes, my viewing lasted no longer than 2 min. Next morning we were sitting outside on the porch drinking coffee discussing the sighting from the night before when we heard a helicopter getting louder and louder until we saw it flying right over the top of the house heading strait back into the bay where I saw the craft dart down into the water.

I looked to see why it was so bright and seen the sun peaking through the clouds but it couldn't explain in my mind why it was shinning. it wasn't a reflection type of shine. it was throughout the object and did not flicker. It was almost like a giant luminous light bulb. It was like the light was the object.

I could tell it wasn't moving because the clouds were moving through it or around it. I sat and watched this for the few minutes that I sat at the light. I noticed the women in the car next to me notice it as well. I sat there focused on the object trying to logicly justify what it was but could not. The light then turned green and I had to drive on.

On the night of Nov. 22, 2009, I had a most bizzare dream of being in a place and going outside and telepathically being told to lay down on the ground and look up. As I did, A large square shaped sort of opened up the sky, a sort of portal I suppose. At that time I saw inside of the openeing two discs which counter rotated and passed through each other. They came to a point where they would reverse course and repeat. I saw some stars in the background of this opening but they were of a different resolution than the others that were not in the opening in the dark sky. Immediately thereafter, a large spiral formed inside of the ""portal"" and another smaller spiral came from the center of this larger one and came to just above where I was laying on the ground. The reason I am reporting this is because on the early morning of December 9, 2009 there was a similar sighting over Norway that was said to be a Russian Bulava rocket launch which had failed creating the two spirals. When I saw this, I was intrigued and actually quite stunned because, it was basically, a reverse of what I had dreamed. I felt it was a strange synchronicity of sorts. In my dream there was the ""opening"" in the sky first followed by the large spiral and then the smaller spiral. In Norway, it was reported in reverse. It was first the small blue spiral, then the large spiral, then the black hole looking image as the spiral dissipated. Not a conventional sighting, but something strange has happened and I feel it is beyond statistical probability to be a coincidence. I was so taken by my dream, that I entered the details into my dream journal immediately upon waking. When the Norway event occurred I called my father right away to tell him about the spiral in Norway and then to read my description from my dream journal. Additionally, and unrelated, my two daughters witnessed twice int the same morning, roughly one week ago, a definite ufo which my daughter snapped a nice photo of with her iphone.

A similar UFO to last night appeared again at 280 degrees West of our location. Tonight we attempted to use a telescope to view the object and although the telescope was centered on object, only blurred light showed through. Viewed through binoculars at 10x50 magnification. We were able to see a disc shaped object, flat at a 120 degree angle with lights on top and bottom in the middle of the disc. The top light was brighter and white, the bottom light strobed blue, red, green and yellow-orange in a random order. The object moved up, down, sharply to the left and right and at odd angles. A second object of similar make, but further away came in about 20 degrees from the horizon and from approximately 220 degrees SSW. It moved North of the brighter object and up to approx 30 degrees and remained located at a 120 degree angle from the object at approx 310 degrees WNW of the main object. It moved in a similar but random pattern once it came across approx 10 mins after sighting of the first UFO. Two Air Force fighter jets were in the sky flying in a circular pattern around the UFO at approx 18 degrees to the horizon, never moving higher. An Air Force surveillance plane was seen crossing the area from the North. None of the aircraft landed at Hill AFB, 1 mile east of our home that we could tell. The fighter aircraft moved off after 12 mins to the south away from the base and the surveillance plane appeared to be on a heading to Salt Lake International Airport where an ANG base is also located. It was in the area of the UFO for no longer than 8 mins. We observed the UFO for one hour, six minutes before going in for the night.

I STARTED WATCHING, AND SAW ORBS - WHITE IN COLOR, ROUND - FLYING TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTTOM CORNER OF THE SCREEN. ABOUT 1.5 SECONDS LATER, I SAW [WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE] ME WALKING FROM MY COMPUTER AREA ACROSS THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN INTO MY BEDROOM.

SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT ""I"" HAD MY HAIR IN BRAIDED PIGTAILS. I DON'T WEAR BRAIDED PIGTAILS. THEN I REALIZED THAT THE APPARITION WAS WALKING THROUGH A CLOSED BEDROOM DOOR.

I WAS IN SHOCK AS I LOOKED ON, AND REALIZED THAT THE SUPPOSED ""GIRL"" WASN'T WEARING A DETAILED SHIRT, OR ANYTHING I WAS WEARING - IT HAD BEEN ABOUT 9 DAYS SINCE THE 17 OF FEBRUARY SO I ACTUALLY REMEMBERED.I HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY MEMORY.

I DIDN'T TOUCH THE RECORDER OR REPLAY THE INCIDENT, ONLY TOOK A PICTURE WITH MY IPHONE OF THE FRAME I PAUSED ON OF THE HUMAN-LIKE APPARITION THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE ME, BUT I WAS NOT HOME AT THE TIME.

The sun wasn't quite up as I was driving north on HWY 95 in Ft. Mohave, AZ. It was just before 7:00 AM on 09/17/2021. 

I spotted a thing with LED-type lights just hanging still by the wires ahead of me and immediately thought it to be strange and futuristic. I noticed that the color was brown and it seemed to be about 2-3 ft tall and about 10-12 inches wide, and it had a light on its top and one on the very bottom. Both lights looked like LED flashlights. But they just seemed to glow a clear white. The thing was titled down slightly, almost as if it was watching something. There is a charter school right across the street. 

Anyway, I pulled over to the other side of the street, in front of the school and got my phone out and clicked the camera app and hit record. By that time, it started moving, so I was not able to record the lights. It's possible the lights went out, but I don't know. 

If I had to describe its shape, I would say it looked like one of those curved water bottles or a gourd. The thing turned to my left, rose, then turned a slight right and just casually went out toward the mountains. 

There was another girl in a black Suburban who had pulled over and was recording it out of her window. I said to her ""What the hell is that thing?"" She didn't respond, that I could tell.

When it looked like it was just going way and wouldn't return, I stopped recording. As soon as I stopped, there was somebody in the turn lane, and I pointed out to the thing going away, and so he made the turn and stopped and I asked him if he sees it. He said, ""Yes"". Then, I explained what it was and he seemed stunned and thanked me for showing him.

The girl that was recording left without talking to me. Maybe she was freaked out. I don't know. 

When I analyzed the video, I noticed that the thing changed shape throughout the recording. 

It had no propulsion system that I could see and it didn't have any landing gear. I didn't hear any sound coming from it all. But the noise of cars going by was pretty loud. 

My feeling is that it is a futuristic military drone and that the brown color is meant for camouflage. But, that fact that it was changing shapes, takes that to a whole different level.",US,

For the 4th of July my girlfriend and I went camping at Owen's River in Owen's Valley near Big Pine and the Big Ears station. Our campsite was on the eastern bank of the river approximately 150-200 yards north of the Taboose Creek river crossing. At around 8 P.M., we watched the Independence firework display (approximately 30 miles south), as well as the occasional displays over Bishop (approximately 25-30 miles north). At around 9 o'clock, when most of the fireworks had stopped, my girlfriend sighted a strange object in the sky east of our camp. By my reckoning, the object was about 3 miles east and between 500 and 800 feet in the air. It hovered just above the top of a peak in the White Mountain Range. From our vantage point, near the easternmost side of the valley, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime, and had a three-layered disk shape (the top and bottom sides more narrow than the center layer, similar to a hamburger shape). Around the middle of the object were a series of revolving lights. They turned in sequence... YELLOW-ORANGE-PINK-RED-WHITE etc., etc. Thge object hovered over the mountains for about 30 minutes, in which time it sporactically darted from place to place, excelerating rapidly then gliding to a stop in diagnol, horizontal, and vertical movements. At one point, the object came closer to our campsite, growing to about the size of a quarter. From it, several beams of white lit up the mountain side and base. The pattern appeared very clearly on the ground, consisting of about 20 to 30 white circles spaced out and forming a hexagon in it's entirety. This light moved over the ground and the side of the mountain like a search light, and at one point actually lit up the tree just above where we were sitting in the bed of my truck. I think it is important to note here that my rottweiler Tank was also aware of the object at this time. He sat at the tail gate of my truck in a guard position and watched the desert around us to the east. He did this! fully alert for some hours. It may be equally important to note that at this time we were yelling back and forth to some other campers about 100 yeard up river to our north who were all watching the same event. Sometime after the the white lights stopped, the object retreated back towards the mountain, at which time it emitted a second series of lights which included a red horizontal beam which hit the mountain side at regular intervuls. This sequence was always followed by a series of vertical lights which scanned over the same area. It appeared to me like a grid. It was during this time (about 1 hour), that my girlfriend noticed another light go up from the mountain. It appeared to have the same shape and spinning lights at as the first, but was much smaller in comparison (if it had indeed taken off from the mountain top, then it would have been a few miles behind the original object. It is very likely that they were actually the same size). Shortly after the second object started to gain alttitude, a third object took off from the mountain from the same area as the first. It was also the same shape as the other two with the same lights, and was the same size as the smaller of the two others. This object drifted straight up while the one that had gone up before it drifted diagnally to the right (or south). The time between the two take-offs was somewhere between 2 and 3 minutes, at which time the grid-like lights from the first object had ceased and it darted upwards to a great height at great speed. The lowest of the objects (the last to ""take off""), stopped climbing for about a minute. It was at this time that we saw a red beam flash beneath it to the mountain top, followed a second later by a strange rushing sound. After this, the three drifted upwards in unison for a few more minutes, then one by one, the revolving lights of each stopped turning and the objects became solid white lights against the black night. It occured to me at this point that they looked remarkably like stars. W! ith the exception of the largest object, they were almost indistinguishable from other stars, almost. They drifted straight upwards in a triangular pattern which they held for hours. The only way I could keep my eyes on them (my eyes were beginning to become confused by the abundance of stars that night and focusing on just one or two lights became increasingly more difficult), was by comparing their drifting movements to that of other stars (the three moved significantly faster than other constellations). I watched them drift upwards until early morning, in which the light of the sun made them impossible to see. I did, however, catch a glimpse of the a metallic reflection high above before the sun broke fully into my eyes. It might be important to note that in the morning, I could see the area where the two had taken off from, and there seemed to be a trail of smoke or vapor which started at the top of the mountain. I fell asleep sometime early in the morning, but was awakened by the sound of two jets (F-16s by the look of them) flying low through the valley and circling the mountain top where we had seen the objects just hours before. The fighters left and came back many times during the day (assuming that they were the same planes), until it started raining around 5 in the afternoon and after that they never returned.

When I looked back up at the night sky --mostly clear -- I saw two, light-flashing rectangles opposite of each other -- and flashing alternately. It was so strange I just stared asking myself what it could be as far as a logical explanation. It was close, the object -- maybe 200 feet off the ground. Total absolute silence. It hung there, those two rectangular lights just flashing. I said hi, so to speak. It began to move, fairly slow -- I think from the sky that was blocked and the way the lights were positioned, it was a curved triangular shape. What was really eerie was the silence -- also the way it moved, gliding -- nothing, absolutely nothing I've ever seen before. And it was close -- either extraterrestrial, black ops or innerterestrial -- or something not explained. If whoever, whatever it was, I'd kind of like it to return.

They flew overhead and disappeared into the clouds to the east one by one. There was first a grouping of 6 followed by 5 more after an interval of maybe a minute.

On 1/14/14 about 7:00 pm my wife and I went outside to have a cigarette on the beach and look at the stars. We noticed several star size lights randomly blinking all over the sky, at times there may be one and other times at least 10 of them. About 7:15 we both witnessed a sphere like white light suddenly appear about 30 degrees off the horizon and straight in front of us heading north, after maybe 10 seconds it went out. A couple minutes later another white light appeared, possibly the same one, and split into two separate lights, one kept going in the same direction the other turning east, after about 10 seconds they went out. Around 10 or so minutes later we saw a rectangular object, we could clearly see 4 square sections that resembled windows and the entire thing was glowing white and horizontal to the ocean, it lasted a little more than 10 seconds before it went out. We both described to each other how it looked just like windows in amazement. A few minutes later the rectangle object appeared again except it was vertical to the ocean and in within 10 seconds went out. Just south of us a single white light appeared over the water that light up the cloud above it and cast a light on the water, after a few seconds it went out. We watched between 6 or 8 of these white lights appear and within seconds go out.Around 7:35 or so we observed a red pulsating object north of us and at a high altitude heading east over the ocean, it was to far away to tell its shape. After a couple minutes it just disappeared. At about 8:00 another red object flying the same path did the same thing.
While watching these lights we heard no noise of any type coming from them.
We have watched these and other types of lights on previous nights, usually between 7 and 8pm and every time we see the star like blinking objects all over the sky we see strange lights like we did on this night.
I've been in the military and in law enforcement and have been around a lot of different aircraft, flares and even seen Chinese lanterns before and no way possible it could be any of these things.
I tried several times to take a photo of these lights but they would go out before I could focus my camera, or they would go out as soon as I turned my camera on. I will keep trying to get a photo of these lights.",US,

Sighting in Panama City Beach, Florida on the balcony of condo, approximately 10:25pm-10:30pm. 

My partner and I were on the balcony looking out at the sky. We noticed a light directly in front of us over the ocean. The object was too far away to determine it's shape, but it was blinking in a wild pattern. The object moved very quickly across the sky. It appeared from the horizon, moving towards us, and within aa minute it disappeared. A few seconds later it was on the other side of the sky and then vanished. As we scanned the sky to find the object, I discovered an apparently different object floating fairly close to us. I'd say within about 500 feet, give or take, just about two condos down the beach. When we first saw this object, we weren't sure what it was. It was just unlike anything else. 

I locked onto it with binoculars and it was such a bright color, it almost didn't look real. My partner took a turn as well and determined it was a cylindrical shape. It was redish-orange and was pulsating in and out as it ascended above the condo at an angle. It didn't seem to be rotating or making any movements besides ascending. My partner said it looked like it was facing one direction, while moving in another. 

When we first sighted the object we were in a state of intrigue. We knew nothing commercial would be flying that close to a condo, and a kite would not glow to that degree, much less pulsate. We reacted by grabbing the binoculars and never taking our eyes off it. It made my heart pound and it's like we couldn't stop watching it. Even now that it's gone, it feels like we should be looking for it. Once it flew over that condo we raced to the front balcony to see if we could still see it, but it was gone. We kept watch for at least 30 minutes afterwards, pacing back and forth from balcony to balcony, but we never spotted it again.

----(I have already reported this once. I am clarifying some information a little. I was thinking about it again today (this weird event pops into my mind every once in a while still.. it really impacted me) and wanted to just clarify info a little bit.)--- 

There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night. It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm. We were in the city on a street driving Northeast, and there were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall, parking lots etc, all lit up with typical lights. 

Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and the sky lit up in a bright flast of light. There was not an apparent point that this light radiated from, rather the entire half of the Southeastern sky was lit up like daylight. ie, the sky was sky blue. For that split second it was like daylight (although the extreme opposite direction, the horizon was still dark). before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything. Literally, it occured in a split second. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal.. 

All three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver STOPPED the car in the middle of the street. Before we were through jumping/hollering/car stopped it was over, though, leaving us to wonder if it really even happened. There was absolutely NO NOISE associated with the event at all. 

We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other "" did that just happen"" at the same time. If we were not all there to assure each other, I think if would have been passed off as imagination, etc. 

I called electric company the next day because we were so freaked out.. no reports of any kind of problem whatsoever. We had called another friend we were going to meet up with several miles away north of us, who was in her car as well with her fiance, and although she saw no flash of light in the sky, she said the lights in the city did flash off for a second where she was at too.

The night was fairly clear...nice weather. There was NO lighting, and no storms in the area.

This event may seem trivial just reading about it, but if you were there you would understand why I have reported it here. The three of us talked often about this event for WEEKS after it occured. We were shaken up for all that night.. something UNREAL occured that defied our senses and rational explanation.

At approx 5:15 P.M. on 2/17/2012 I was bar-b-q ing in my back yard, in the vicinity of harbor blvd and Chapman ave in Anaheim,Ca. I was facing west towards Harbor blvd. when I happen to look to my right which would be in a north by north east direction, at which time I noticed 2 objects with very bright flashing lights at what appeared to be within a couple hundred ft. of each other, judging from their distance to me. They were moving in the same general direction towards the east. the sun was setting so it was hard to discern an exact shape, but appeared to be oval. One of the craft was a little ahead and just above the other and traveling what seemed as together. When literally in a few flashes of the lights the top one had ""jumped""several hundred feet head faster then the eye could follow.then is resumed its very slow course of flight. immediately after the rear vehicle strobed faintly as it changed directions instantly going backwards and up at about a 60 degree angle for a little less then a thousand feet and without slowing down ricocheted downward for about the same distance then it squiggled like a pin ball as it flew in the direction of the other vehicle for about 15/20 sec. Then they both stopped moving in a linear direction and hovered. The top vehicle didnot hover in one spot, in fact it would be in one spot one second, flash and pop up in another spot instantly in up/down and angled directions at different distances. sometimes the lights seemed to flash and roll and change colors, and sometimes the lights would strobe at varying brightnesses like an arc welder. That vehicle at one time froze in place and ejected a much smaller object that bounced around like a pin ball then hovered for a few seconds then sped off in a westerly direction in an erratic acceleration and decceleration and zig zag pattern no terrestrial aircraft is capable of. the vehicle that was behind and below ( what I will call) the pirmary vehicle, moved up/down left/right across such large distances you almost couldnt tell it was the same one. It eventually ricocheted and strobed away also towards the west like a stone skipping across a pond at a mezmerizing speed. The brightest/largest craft hovered mostly laterally, sometimes vanishing then reappearing instantly in another spot without being able to follow it from one point to another, other times you could easily follow its movement. After a couple of minutes it moved up and in a northerly direction. One second it was there the next it was gone. from my vantage point it seemed to be between disneyland and Cal State Fullerton. When I first saw them my first reaction was aircraft dangerously to close to one another. It didnot appear as though they were a greater distance apart. eventhough that is often the case whereby the line of sight only gives the illusion one is closely above the other. And after they flew forwards and backwards and all the other stuff I knew it wasnt a couple of incompetent or unfortunate pilots.

This is the first time I've ever reported a UFO sighting, though after yesterday evening, I find it VERY necessary.

I left work in Harrisburg, PA at 4:30 p.m. to do some quick Christmas shopping at the outlets in Hershey, PA. As I headed down route 422 through the town of Hershey, I noticed an object at about 45 degrees up in the sky to the north, over Hersheypark from 422. What I saw in the sky was very hard to describe. At first I thought it was a large airplane reflecting sun periodically, but when the shining/relecting faded, nothing was visible whatsoever. I kept noticing this light as I continued through town on 422 until I was waiting at the light to turn on to 743 when I got a real good look at it and it looked like 2 separate lights close together in the sky. Once again, the lights just faded out. 

I turned on to 743, and drove up to the outlets, turned into the outlet center, and quickly parked facing north. I grabbed my binoculars, which are always with me in my Jeep, and waited for the lights to again show themselves. It took less than a minute for them to appear, but this time there were two separate groups. One group to the left with just two lights, and another group due north with 5 lights. It was interesting to watch the lights appear since they would each illuminate individually, then fade out individually like a spark from a campfire, but in the same order they originally lit up, and constantly remaining in the exact same position in the sky, appearing in a subtle upward arc. I tried looking at them through my binoculars, but they immediately fogged up thanks to the cold evening air. I felt so helpless and frustrated, standing there watching this, with no one else to witness it, and no camera or camcorder. 

The event lasted a total of about 20 minutes, between being in my vehicle, and watching from the parking lot. They slowly wandered off to the east/north east, still appearing every couple minutes and then again fading out. 

If anyone has any other info on this sighting, please find a way to contact me via the administrators of this site who do in fact have my email and physical address. I'd love to have an opportunity to talk with someone else about this.",US,

I want to prefix my statement by saying I didn't take a photo, my hands are naturally very shaky so I didn't think I would be able to yet a good shot of it anyhow. 

Secondly I would describe myself as a believer of extraterrestrial intelligence, but beyond that I try not to concern myself with the details of specific claims; the universe is just too vast and expansive to not have something ELSE out there. 

Finally I am of sound mind. I did have three beers that evening, as it was an outdoor festival (southwest Washington fair). I was at the beer garden watching Hell's Belles (an all female AC/DC tribute band) with my friend Rob. I don't partake in mind altering substance. I don't drink often. I don't even smoke cigarettes. I take sinus medication for allergies, a thyroid pill for my hashimotos thyroiditis and wellbutrin for depression. Otherwise I don't subject myself to anything mind or conscious altering and I never have in my 35 years.

What I saw last night was not necessary ""extraordinary"", as I very well could have seen a drone or a helicopter. I see drones and helicopters often. It was around 8:30pm when I looked up and saw a stationary craft with three lights blinking in succession. It seemed eerily still. It didn't seem to act in the way I would expect a helicopter to. It very well could have been a drone but it seemed too high up and too far away to be a commercial drone. If it was a standard drone anyone could purchase I don't think I would even notice it, let alone be able to follow it until it was no longer in my line of sight. 

I continued to watch it a bit. It stayed still so I sort of shrugged it off and continued watching the band, figuring it was just a drone. A few moments later I looked back up and saw it go into the north and stayed stationary for a short while. It then changed direction and deviated to my left and flew out of my line of sight. It did pop up once more briefly above where the [south] stage was to the horizon, but went back out of my line of sight. I asked my friend Rob if he saw it after it went off into the horizon but he did not see it. He started glance in the distance periodically after but did not see it. At the time of the sighting it was still light out. Enough natural light that the lights were bright enough to get my attention. If it had been completely dark I probably wouldn't have paid attention.

It very well could have been a drone. I would really like to know what air traffic was like in Lewis County last night. It just seemed too still, too high and too bright to be a helicopter or commercial drone. 

There probably is a rational explanation for it, but there just seemed to be something kind of uncanny and eery about it. I grew up on an island in Alaska and I've been in a helicopter myself about three times. I've seen helicopters my whole life and this just didn't seem to act in a way a helicopter would. It seems much more like a drone. But again it seemed too large, bright and high up to be a commercial drone.

I would love to know if there was a drone in the area last night. It stayed stationary and changed direction so it's obviously not a satellite or some sort of natural phenomenon. Since the fair was going on, i wouldn't be surprised if others saw this. However people were probably too distracted to look up to see what was literally right over their heads.

Id just stepped out of my friends house after a comedic session of Dungeons & Dragons. Wed watched TV, talked about video games, the usual for our age group. A normal Sunday night. I was the last one to leave. I didnt expect to see something in the sky, but then again, I dont think anyone does.

It was one of those rare cloudless nights where LAs famous light pollution doesnt ruin a decent view of the stars over the suburbs. Im originally from a very small town, so I dont take celestial beauty for granted. I looked up at the sky to admire the stars, and thats when I saw it.

My first thought was airplane, but this was immediately replaced by drone? because it was too fast for a commercial flight, and completely silent. And then I thought that it couldnt have been a drone, because again, it was completely silent, and the most common drones are quadcopters. This thing was in the shape of a chevron, and dark gray. It was a little larger than the moon, which was slightly farther away. 

Another thing that perplexed me besides the speed were the lights. Three of them, one on each wing end and one under the middle corner, unblinking, and a dim gray. Ive never seen gray lights in my life.

The chevron was headed southeast, when suddenly, without slowing down, it made a sharp, tight U-turn, pivoted, and disappeared before my eyes. I didnt blink, I didnt look away for a second, and there were no clouds for it to hide behind. It was there, and then it was gone. I don't think we have the technology to make planes turn the way this thing did.

I was seeing something in my hallway yet it was more of an image or spirit. Matter of fact there were 3 of them together. One short, one medium and one that was taller than the two. They looked in on me and ducked out of sight as I looked to see them. Just out of sight. I never got up to even investigate. I knew they were only spirits. Yet much like the aliens we see on TV. So a night or two of visits and I just prayed and rolled over as I might if a demon or something was around. I knew faith was my only protection. Then the taller one on the third night came in my room just before time to sleep. I rolled over but watched him as he came around the end of the bed. He took the image of a device or sensor and stuck it in my knee. My body went paralyzed for a brief. Like an epidural shot. So I just waited until I felt ok. No real problem since he left right after that. Never opening any doors just appeared in my place. The next night the little on came up to t! he side of the bed nearest to my head and I could see him but like always knew he was in spirit form so Id never be able to touch him or defend myself besides faith. He got up kind of close, about a foot, if even that much from me and said the wordTHC. I smoked right much marijuana back then so it wasnt a surprise to hear the reference. Then he said a word Id never heard before Transduced. I had a dictionary in the drawer by the bed. I looked in it right away for the meaning. Low and behold it means by supernatural means to travel in spirit to another place is to transduce yourself. I knew that I had really seen Aliens in my home. Then years later I had a bone spur in my heel. I worked at a temp service and was working extra hours on a good paying job. I had put in overtime and 12 hours that day even. My heel was hurting on the cement floors all day. Another alien came into my sight. In spirit and said he was send from God. He asked me if I wanted him to make it go! away. I just thought back to him. I think telepathically the ! answer yes and a glow of light came from his head toward my heel. I felt it warm a brief. The pain ended, and I never felt it again. I did go get the spur removed as normal but never felt any pain to mention from it from that day on. A little on jokes with me all the time in the spirit realm which I see in both realms, gifted I suppose. He says he is from God sent to watch over me. I think angels come in different forms. I believe I saw God even in person the same way. Once as an old man and another time as a big greenish grayish blackish supernatural being I think. Maybe even in flesh somewhere in space. He projects himself having instant Daffodils and honey bees, dipped in olive oil or with white wine sprinkled over the flowers as one of his favorite things to eat. Said he had only revealed himself to three men that in any way of the sort. They were Rafael on a boat, Moses and then me the as the third, if you count me twice. Then its four. I lived in Israel 2000 yrs. ago. I w! as told by 3 psycic people that I was Messiah. I am supposed to reveal myself 2012. God hasnt affirmed it. I just know Antichrist will rise and you wont be able to put money in a drink machine and get it to work. God will give him that kind of power as best I have seen it. Then after brutalizing me as a young man and losing my friends and family, finally come looking for my resolve of his rein. Kill him and war it out before he gets more powerful. 40 days of war has been prophecied. I pray for you all. The number will be in telepathic form sent out for all who will receive.

On March 29, 2017, I was walking along the bluffs on Varsity area in Calgary. At 3:49 pm local time, looking south, I decided to take photos of the sun and cloud formations as they were particularly beautiful. I noticed the orbs immediately after checking to make sure my photos were clear. The orbs were so perfect and so clear I knew it was not just a reflection of the sun. There was only one orb which made it even more apparent that it was unusual. I took 3 photos in rapid succession, 1 second apart. Between each photo, the orb moved in apparent dramatic distances, but stayed within range of the camera lens. Moments before I had taken the photos, I had said out loud, "" Hello friendly ETs.""

My family and I had just come back home from a graduation dinner party. I went outside to feed my cats before going to bed as usual. My mother checked to make sure the lights were unplugged, the cats had sufficient water, etc when she claimed to see a light in the sky.

She called me over, so I went to look. I looked and only saw an airplane, which ws oncoming and looked bright. I told her it was only a plane. However, as the plane flew off, a tiny blinking stationary light appeared that wasn't previously there.

At this point my father came over to observe the blinking light. We both watched for a while and realized it hadn't moved at all, which was suspicious.

We continued to watch it until all of the sudden, just below it, a bright yellowish light appeared out of nowhere. It was as bright as the plane that was in the airspace previously, so we thought it was just another one.

Except, this one would appear to move a little in one direction, then completely vanish, then reappear with a flash and move in the other direction, slowly moving farther away and West-bound.

We watched it for a few minutes. It then flashed again, but this time, the light dispersed and appeared to create a disc-like shape, as if the object had transformed. It was very dim orange in this transformation, and would vanish within a few seconds.

This happened a few times, before the craft finally disappeared behind a line of Palm trees.

My father and I witnessed it turning into the disc, while my mother saw it brightly flash. We all saw the stationary blinking light.

That stationary blinking light remained in the sky for much longer. It was still there at 12:45 AM, so we went to bed and did not see it disappear.

The crafts were far from us, so we did not hear any sound from them. We didn't feel any different, and there was no loss in time. We did, however, feel very much surprised and even somewhat afraid as we observed them.

We tried to capture them on film but they were too far to be seen on the camera.",US,

Then i took another testshoot, from the sky and put down the camera from my eyes to checkout the photo,then i look forward to the sky, and saw this red, glowing ball in front of me.( i was to perplexed to think about the distance of it.)

It change the direction so fast that it couldn't be an flight plane .

I mean it comes in 5 seconds, at the time were i shoot a simple photo stands there and is faster far away than it comes .

So my friend and i take a look at the photo, and discussing about it what it could be !

I didn't saw any light streak in real, and on the photo you also can't see any of this, no lightcone, or flashing lights, like a plane would have.

We stand for more than 5 minutes of the balcony.
And look in the sky with the hope to see another on of this object1s (whatever it was )

After 5 minutes of waiting another object is fly on us with an white dazzling light, but after a few seconds it disappear.

It comes without any noise and flight path, and goes without it, exactly like the first sighting but this time with an white light.

I am a filmmaker. I bought a used mini dv camcorder from a pawn shop (at least i think it was from a pawn shop - read on) several years ago and there was a used mini DV tape inside. I don't really care to see people's home movies so I didn't look at the tape until much later. 

I was importing my own old footage into the computer when I rediscovered this tape. There was some scenery shots on the tape as well as a shot of the Glacier National Park sign on the tape. There was only about 3 minutes of footage on the tape and there wasn't any candid shots of people - just scenery. It may have been a new tape for the shooters. 

The tape ends with a shot of some glowing lights zooming through a huge canyon (presumably in GNP?). I don't know if it is fake or not...looks real - and if it is faked then how did footage end up on a physical tape inside a camera? 

Anyways...I would like to find the people who shot this. I have purchased sooo many used cameras for shoots throughout the years that I honestly cannot determine when or where I bought this cam with its mysterious tape inside.

Almost into Muskingum County we had noticed a really bright, what we thought was a star, light in the sky. We kept talking about how bright it was and thought that it had to be a star because it wasnt moving but that we had never seen a star that bright. Even the North Star in our area doesnt show as bright as this light on the clearest of nights. My mom mentioned that maybe it was the position of the star or the fact that the night was so clear. As we moved closer my mom said that it almost looked like there was a red light blinking on the side of it. 

So then we assumed it was a tower of some sort but the bigger white light still didnt blink like most tower light do and have to because they are so high in the sky. We got closer and it got brighter and larger. As we rounded the bend and started to enter into Zanesville it was right there above a field and some houses on the West Bound side on 70. What we had initially thought was one large white star, then a white tower light with one red smaller light, ended up being a triangle shaped object with 3 large separate white lights and two red lights on the back end points of the object. It was still very still, almost hovering over this area of fields and houses. I wanted to pull off to the side but with the rate of speed I was going and there were cars right behind me I couldnt get over in time. The first exit into Zanesville was just around the right bend. We hurried off of the exit, then headed back west on 40 which runs parallel to 70 to the area that we saw this craft. We drove the road to the area and it wasnt there. It was so big and so slow that it should have still been there. But it was gone. It just vanished.

My cousin and I were looking for something to do so we decided to go on a road trip. We were traveling north in Iowa from our homes, and were driving for about 55 minutes through some remote areas that I was familiar with. Between the towns of Springbrook and Preston we noticed a strange light off to the left of our vehicle in a field. The light was an odd blue oval shape. The light appeared to have no source, and looked transparent. The light also seemed to have a smoky quality, but there was no smoke moving. I noticed a small red light flash near the road (which was much closer to the car than the blue light). We also saw identical lights in and around the blue light. The red lights were very dimm, except for the one next to the road. We circled around a 3 times and it was in the same place and we saw the same red lights. We then drove back to our and discussed the matter, and concluded there was no reasonable explanation for what we saw.

My sister and I were driving on Bob Hope Drive in Ranch Mirage, CA, three nights ago (2/7/12) and saw a craft right over Bob Hope Drive. It was at around 6:30 to 6:45 p.m. and the road was full of cars. I was driving in shock, with my eyes on the flying object. I kept asking my sister if she agrees that its a flying saucer type of craft and its absolutely unbelievable. She agreed. I almost got hysterical but tried to hold myself back from screaming in disbelief because my 3 year old was with us and also because I didn't want my sister to make fun of me later. It was so close to us and to the ground that I could have counted all the white, round lights. It had one light on top (I saw the red light in the middle as protruding from an dome or peek at the top of the craft). The bottom of the craft was not visible for most of the sighting except for a few seconds. It appeared to be in the shape of a cone. The bright, round lights along the circular edge of the craft turned on and off erratically. It started moving further away and we kept trying to follow it. It took me only about a minutes or so to turn right onto a side road so I can stop away from the busy traffic. By then, the craft was all the way over the mountains towards Joshua Tree (?). It was a little strange that it had gotten so far away even though it was seemingly flying quite slow. I wouldnt call it flying. It was moving in a circular motion, like a frizbee. As we were stopped and continued to watch it for a few minutes, it came back over an area in front of us. I believe its an empty desert area along Hwy 10. At this point, we were on a secluded road and my sister was a little frightened and joked about abductions. I wasnt brave enough to try to follow it any longer. It got further and further away in an easterly direction. Its absolutely unbelievable and very frustrating that no one else reported a sighting and there was no coverage on the local news. I guess people are either skeptical or embarrassed to report it. What we saw resembles the videos from recent sightings on the internet from Russia, San Rafael, CA, and uk. Someone also forwarded a link to a website to me where I found a report of a sighting over the same area (Hwy. 10 in Palm Desert) two days before our sighting. Someone has commented on it and described a sighting on the night of our sighting (Feb 7th) from his house in Palm Desert, CA. Please be certain that what I saw was a ufo in the shape of a flying saucer at pretty close range and very obvious. I am absolutely certain that it was not a weather balloon, blimp, cloud formation/aura, airplane, helicopter, etc. It looked and behaved like every flying saucer I have seen throughout the years in sci-fi movies. If it was a new, secret military craft in the shape of a flying saucer, I would be very impressed by it because it continuously stopped mid air. 

I know Im not allowed to post links to other websites but the two reports over Palm Desert area on the night of our sighting and two days before our sighting should not be overlooked. If you decide to contact me, I can forward the link to you.",US,

Hello. I am contacting you because of a photo that was posted on Facebook by my cousin.

In March of 2004, her husband was on a flight returning back to the United States. I'm not sure where he took the picture or at what time. It was during the day so I'm guessing it was past noon.

In the photo, you can clearly see a huge flying disk-like object. It looks to be black and it looks like it's coming out of the clouds. The photo was taken from the window seat.

She posted the photo over a year ago and the thought just occurred to me that it could be an alien craft of some sort.

It was not cloudy out, but there was a haze in the sky where the object appeared. There was no rain falling, and stars could be seen. The object moved fast, and had a straight trajectory with no arc as it maintained a parallel path with the ground. There was only one object.

I could not discern the distance above ground, however it was lower than a typical airplane or jet and there was no sound. The speed was extremely fast.

We were watching for about 45 seconds as it moved very rapidly across the sky in a straight line then the orange light dimmed, and completely disappeared.

I sensed, or heard something, like a strong breeze moving the trees in the woodline to my left, as I turned to the left, looking downhill, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Feeling spooked, I turned to keep walking. A dark moving shape came from my left side, rising quickly, traveling to the right. I saw it best when it was about at my ten o'clock high position. It looked like a Huey helicopter, with a similar style windscreen, towards the front, the rest of the craft reminded me most of a Star Trek shuttle craft, but it was very dark in color, and I only caught a glimpse.

At 3:15 a.m. on Monday, March 24, 2014, I was waiting for the light to change at the intersection of I-20 and Green Oaks Blvd. in southwest Arlington, TX. I was traveling south. 

One block south of me and traveling north toward me, a dark grey and black saucer-shaped craft topped the hill. It was as wide as the three lanes of traffic and had two red triangular lights on either side in a similar position to where the parking lights are on an automobile but on the bottom edge. However, no light from these reflected onto the ground and they were not bright like headlights, but they were large rectangles and most definitely red. 

The largest part of the craft was very dark gray and the top bubble part was black. This craft was only a few inches off the roadway. My light changed and as I proceeded toward it, it was as if something came between us and it was no longer visible. As there was nothing there to actually come between us, I feel as if it cloaked! itself, but it was gone. This area is very well lit as there are street lights on either side and there are businesses on both sides of the road so my visibility was excellent. At this time of morning, there was no one else on the road except for it and me. This road runs directly behind my house and this happened 1/2 block north from my backyard. I went home and immediately called my friend who I had just dropped off and told her about it. However, over a period of 20 minutes, we were only able to maintain a phone connection for about 5 minutes, as our call would get dropped and I would get the message Call Failed which never comes through when a call is dropped but rather when it doesnt go through to begin with. I would try to call her back and it would do absolutely nothing. Just like dead air. She left me a voicemail message but my phone had not rang. She would call me and get the same nothing. One time, I called her and as the phone was ringing, it soun! ded as if there was a third party on the line and I could hear! some sc ratching like claws on a piece of wood but just when the call should have gone to voicemail, it just disconnected and I got the Call Failed message. She said when we finally were able to talk that she had never experienced anything like that ever before with a cell phone. I hadnt either. I was unable to go to sleep until about 6:00 a.m. The next day she told me that she had checked the Arlington Police Dept. active police blotter after we hung up and that from 3:00 a.m. until 3:30 a.m. there had been 9 calls to 911 that were only classified as disturbances within a 1-mile radius of where this occurred and my house.

While watching the Chicago Air and Water show, the fighters in particular, I noticed a sliver cylindrical object hovering above Lake Michigan; a couple of miles out, and then two or three miles straight up. It hovered there during the Army skydivers and the Blue Angels performances; after each pass they made, I would focus my high-powered binoculars on the same spot and would find it there. I kept moving away from it and going back every so often to make sure it wasnt a trick of light or something.

The object was metallic, silver, highly reflective. It was slowly bobbing up and down; I could tell as the sunlight moved vertically upon its surface as it did. There were some low altitude clouds moving from south to northwest, I lost the object after a very thick cloud obscured it. 

I was NOT very sure of what this was until I replayed it over in my head and ran down a list of possible things it could have been. It had no wiggly motions, like a loosened balloon. There was no wavy visual effect; I only wish my binocs were much, much stronger to see closer. I was only able to just make out the overall shape of it. It was definitely cylindrical, on its vertical axis like a signpost. Near static position, bobbing oh so slowly, as Ive said.

The craft had a solid white sphere on both the left and right sides and was held together by a thin black rod in the middle. The craft swayed as it flew at a moderate speed. A few minutes later, another identical craft followed the same route. As the hour progressed, up to 14 followed in the same area of the sky. No more than two flew over at a time.

I was sitting on the back porch at around 4 pm on a beautiful clear day in October of 2005. My house faces north and I was facing south and as I looked over my left shoulder to the east I saw an egg or football shaped object. It was a shinny metalic object and from where I sat I could see the reflection of the sun on the rear end. It had no windows,wings,stabilizer or anything sticking out. It made no sound and left no trail behind it and my best estimation of it's speed was 200 to 250 mph and an altitude of around 1000 to 1500 ft. I called my wife out to see it so we both saw the same thing.

In Oct. of 2006 I was sitting on the same porch with the same kind of weather and looked east and saw a contrail of a very high flying airplne. It was so high I could not see the craft it's self so I went into the house and got the bynocuylars. As I was looking at the plane this very same egg shaped craft flew trough my field of vision and was traveling very fast(est.3 or 4000 mph) on incline upwards. I was employed by a major airline for 27 years so I do know the difference. I have never seen this type of craft before

On 09/26/15 at 10:28 pm My friend and I were in the car driving East on State Route 303 in Windham Ohio we both observed seven(7) amber colored star-like glowing objects hovering in the sky in front of us. At first I thought they may have been helicopters flying in formation as we often see in the area due to the nearby Ravenna Ohio Arsenal. Upon closer observation I could see that the objects did not have the shape of a helicopter or plane, display the usual lights, nor produce any audible sounds as planes and helicopters do. The objects seemed to hover then move slowly off in a Noth-Westerly direction. One object was very low to the treeline and shined the brightest. The driver asked if I would like her to pull off the road and stop. Being it was dark and we were the only car on a long lonely stretch of country road I advised her to continue to drive slowly so I could see which way they were heading as I felt a bit uneasy and not sure what the objects were or what the low flying one may do if it was an actual ""unknown"" craft and decided to pursue us. We continued to drive in the direction in which they were heading but eventually lost sight of them as the view from the road was poor due to the high trees. I am a MUFON field investigator and also am affiliated with several other cryptozoological and paranormal groups in the area and can say that the area has had it's share of reports of UFOs, cryptids and hauntings some of which I have investigated myself. I would also like to note that I have seen my share of Chinese lanterns and drones in the past and the objects we observed did not move nor look like either.",US,

Thank you for your time and effert. In 1987 I was assighned to The United States Dept. of the Interior, B.L.M. at the Olancha Ca. This was a prototype Uni-Mog test,we were responsible for over one million acres. At approx. 22;30 we were dispatced from heatquarters in San Bernadino to a fire reported by a deputy sherrif, in the Panamont valley area, this I thought unuseual since a unit was available much closer than us. We responded, and on the highway to death Valley, Panmont Valley and to a small town called Darwen, in 15 minite of Traval time,at appox 60 mph we saw what I at first thought was a semi-truck on the left, we whre going east,just off the road. We did not have on the overhead lights since we were in the midle of nowhere and did not use lights and sirens in unpopulated areas. We slowed and stoped in the middle of the rd. We all saw a saucer, at least 60 feet wide,appox15 to 20 feet high, below the raise road bed, light up by a bright :bug light yellow interior light,showing through portholes across the upper area that was nearly even to the road,since it rested on the desert floor and not the raised highway. My engeneer became very frightend and rolled up into a fetal possition on the floor of the vehicle. He is a Georgia country boy, and not a small man at all. My Capt. who was driveing at the time looked catatonic, and simply said,""Ive seen these before"". I turned on the overhead rotaiting lights,the saucer turned off its lights. I tried to radio headquarters and the radio was dead. I left the engine and approched the saucer. I knew this was real and was very excited and interested,so I touched it with my hand, wearing a glove. The saucer rose up, no noise,lights out,and I could see it blocking out the stars, they were very bright. It rose to perhaps 30 feet,crossed directly over my head and landed just as it was before,just off the road and slightly b! elow it, now instead of arms length away,30 to 40 feet away. At this time for the first time during this incident I felt fear instead of amazment. I thought something was trying to sneak up on me from behind out of the dark. My memory is not clear from this point. My crew remained in the engine the whole time, somehow I foun myself handsignaling my Capt. in the back up lights of the engine , dircting him to back down a very narrow winding road. I dont know how we got their, engine,crew and all. Eventually we came to a gate, lock in place,but unlocked, and ended up in the town of darwen. I think we were on China Lake Naval Weapons Depot. and drove in to Dawen. You do not just go to China Lake . You will be shot if you manage to get far enough, even in uniform. I understand the Navy took the wholle town of Darwen and leveled it, due to its closeness to the base. It was just a few gold miners their.I filed a report with the navy and was contacted by a rear Admeral who interveiwed me and kept asking me if I was aware they had a captured Russian gun ship, helicopter and that it was classified. He aked what I knew about helicopters, and when I informed him my duties requiered to fly offten, he said,""with your knowladge of helicopters,what type would you say this was"" Fially I responded with"" I would say it is no type of helicopter I am familure with.

I am over what ever affect this had on me now, However, I did have some physical symptoms, and begain sleeping with my Ruger Pistol chambered under my pillow. I had some fear after this. That I do not understand, I was not affraid at the time, and was allways comfertable in any situation. It was unusual for me to keep a weapon in a state of that readyness in my own home. Any way, thank you for your time. ((name deleted)).

on the night of 12/31/13 - 1/1/14 i was celebrating new years eve gambling at my local lottery deli. while i was playing, my brother came inside to where i was gambling and told me to come outside quickly to look at something. he didn't tell me what it was, he just turned and headed for the door outside. i had no idea what it was he wanted me to see, but i got up from my machine anyways and followed him outside. an employee of the establishment was also following. when we got outside, my brother went into the parking lot, and we followed him, and pointed in the southwest sky and said ""look"". when we looked in the direction he was pointing, there it was, three distinct red lights in the shape of a triangle. the lights were slowly pulsating and then light on the left side of the triangle appeared to move straight up in the sky until it was at the same elevation as the top light in the triangle, and then it moved back to its original place in the triangle. when then light resumed its position, all three lights suddenly accelerated to the south at a speed which i can only describe as faster than anything ive ever seen. the lights just disappeared. at the time of this sighting, the weather conditions were light clouds with a ceiling of approximately 25000 ft. visibility was good. the strangest thing about this sighting was that exactly 1 year to day prior, at almost the same time, my brother and i spotted the exact same thing in about the same place in the sky. i can only say that whatever it was, it was BIG and it accelerated at a speed that was out of this world. i don't know what i saw, but i know what i didn't see. it was not an airplane, helicopter, flares, a star or planet. it wasnt a meteor, it wasnt fireworks, or any of the other explanations that the skeptics will give. im not saying it was an alien craft, but im also not saying it wasnt. i don't know what it was i saw.",US,

Driving north on highway 1 toward town of mendocino. Saw two aircraft blinking in night sky, flying in tight formation, though it might be a refueling which i have witnessed here before. I had told my girlfriend about witnessing refueling and she mentioned on this occasion, are they refueling? We pulled over to watch, lost site of the objects until they came back into site as they turned to the north. At that moment an object moving steadily across the big dipper passed into vision, and we realized the two aircraft were following this object. the object was not blinking but was as bright as the brightest star/planet on this clear night. it steadily moved and circled to the east and then south. the aircraft were blinking white and red lights and were following quite a ways behind. At some point the second aircraft went in another direction and only one followed this object. The thought that the other craft was following a second object occurred. At this point my girlfriend and i were aware that this was abnormal. I believe in UFOs and stay in touch with various disclosure project/conspiracy type information and am familiar with various sightings. The object followed was as bright as the brightest star and then over the course of about 5 seconds, began to dim and dissappear into nothing. At first we thought that was what it did, and after talking about it at a local pub with some folks the thought occurred that it might have left at a high rate of speed in the opposite direction from us. It was hard to tell how high the object and aircraft were....all was silent. They were also quite a distance away...at least 10 miles by my best guess. When the object dissappeared there was left the aircraft that was following, all by itself and it continued south in the area and direction of highway 101. Thats about it...wish I had more!",US,

My girlfriend and I left my mothers house around 10:20pm on Monday night. She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn't want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway.

We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway. Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left. It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving. We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us.

When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn't our UFO at all. It was a second one.

We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFOs were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn't nearly as much traffic on this highway as I'd like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I've ever heard, ""Did you see that, over in the trees?"" I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking ""lights"" next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she'd seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it. The mere thought of what it might be scared me enough to immediately pull out onto the highway and drive quickly away. We kept searching for the UFOs as we drove toward Huntsvill! e. We were unable to clearly identify the crafts again.

I've wanted to contact your group for quite some time about this event and am doing so because I believe I have lost time. 

Very simply, this sighting was 100% brought on by me and my two friends lighting off mortars late summer of 1984. It was around the 3rd or 4th shell where we heard a very dull, low base hum and there it was directly across from us, hovering low off the horizon. 

We stood there and it hovered. Flashing lights, typical for what you might think you would see. 1200ft across and about 300 -400 ft wide. I really think they were waiting for us to light off another one, but instead my friends Dad was running up the stairs because his mom was screaming, ""get the camera! get the camera!""

Not much after that it made like a ""pop"" sound and had this tiny few seconds of a crawl away from us then bam! it was gone. 

The whole incident was beautiful and exciting, but what happened after is the part why I'm contacting you. This all occurred a little after dusk and I had a very very strict Italian father who literally would punish me if I was home at 9:01 ( my curfew was 9:00AM). 

I got home at 11:05! The incident was over at 8:30PM the latest and for me to ride my bike to my house was no longer than 8 minutes. The crazy part is I came home soaking wet, drenched in fact with perspiration and my parents were like ""its ok...go to bed"" 

And I did. I just went to my room and for around 3-4 years I couldn't remember at all that the night occurred. My two other friends refused to talk about it and both of this kids parents are dead now. I really have no issue with the sighting, but now I've come to regret not knowing why I have lost time and I think this lapse has somehow altered my life a bit. 

So I want to know what happened during those lost hours.",US,

It hovered low in the horizon and did appear to be moving only slightly. It wasn't perfectly still but you could tell it was slightly moving. I used the term fireball but it could have been a mass of lights, orang/red in color appearing at a distance as a fireball. I tried to take a pic but it was too far away.

It was Wednesday the 11th of January, 2012.

I was in our house on the 2nd floor looking out the windows. My husband and I had been hearing these really loud jets in the sky for about a half an hour or so, so I went upstairs to see how close they were. I noticed the trails of the jets were all around the sky above our house.

I went outside to get a look at these trails. The trails did loops directly above our house on all sides. There were a few jets with blinking lights, around 7 doing maneuvers all around the sky in view.. The trails were heavy and hanging for a long time so I stayed outside and looked for awhile.

My husband had gone outside to the shed. I went back upstairs to check on the kids and looked out the window again, this time on the other side of the house (to the southwest). I saw 2 large orange-red orbs above the tree line. They were larger than the moons diameter . They were lined up at a 35% angle off the tree line. The craft made no sound.

They looked as if they were going to fly right at our house, so I gathered the kids and took them downstairs. I actually thought at first it must be a really large plane that was going to crash into the house, I was assuming it was traveling at great speed. When nothing happened I went back upstairs to look and they were still the same distance away but parallel with the tree line, they hovered there for a minute before turning off for less than a second then reappearing. When they reappeared one was in between the spots they had been and the other was to the left of it, the same distance apart. After a minute or so the lights just disappeared.

My husband was in the shed the whole time and saw the orange glow shining on the back wall, but was too low below the tree line to see the actual lights.

Since then nothing until last night. We had been hearing the jets again and as I was putting our son to bed at around 9:00 I checked the sky (to the west) and saw an orange-red glow above the tree line. It was further away this time. I called my husband up to look and we watched it glow bright, change color, fade to a speck and glow again. This happened for a few minutes and then it lowered into the trees out of our view.

I was flying a radio controlled airplane when I first saw the object in line to where my airplane was flying. I quickly landed my airplane and watched a chrome, cigar shaped UAP moving very slowly from the southern sky to the northern sky about 35 degrees in elevation facing East. It appeared to move in a straight line and constant altitude estimated to be 1/2 to one mile away at approximately 10 to 15 thousand feet. It was big. I know that aircraft do not fly that slow or silent. After about 1 minute it seemed to emit a very bright light that then split into two bright, constant lights for approximately 15 seconds. The lights then stopped shining. The lights were white . The lights were so bright that they obscured the outline of the UAP. After the lights turned off the shape of the aircraft was plainly visible again. It must have been very large based on the distance it seemed to be. Eventually it disappeared behind a tree line but since the park I was flying in is basically a bowl, I assumed it continued its same flight characteristics. I picked up my model plane and took off again. After flying less then one minute, either an identical UAP or the same UAP was seen again, flying again from south to north at the same altitude, degree of elevation, distance and speed as the first UAP I saw. Again I saw the same lights at the same point that I had seen on the first sighting. Again I landed my model airplane and watched it moving at the same rate of speed and identical flight path. It was as if I was seeing the exact same UAP a second time in the exact same way as I had seen it the first time. The sky was clear. There are no airline flights seen where I live, a small, rural town in southern Minnesota. This UAP(s) was silent, big, chrome, and very slow moving. There were no other people at the park that I was flying at. It was so slow though anyone in town looking up in the same direction would have to have seen it. The second time I saw it it disappeared behind the same point in the tree line from where I was standing. I canât explain how clearly I saw it. It was so obvious. I regret that I did not have a camera to film it as I do not even bring my cell phone while flying model airplanes.",US,

I was outside watching fireworks, when above the mountains a yellow round dot appeared. Then 3 more just appeared and it looked almost like a square. 

My mom also came out to see and by then it was only one object. But when we looked behind us, there was another single ball of yellow. 

My sister and a friend said they also saw the yellow ball. They thought maybe it was a Chinese lantern but it did not rise into the air and float around. And they were in a formation when all 4 appeared. It was just there. No floating up, just appearing. Then they were gone.

I apologize for not being able to report this sooner, as our home phone lines have been out for over a week, and we unfortunately have dial-up.  

 It was Wednesday morning, December 20, 2006. I had an apppintment with a local car dealership, as I am leasing my vehicle, so there was a lease-pull-ahead going on, and my truck qualified, not to mention I had alot of other errands and last minute Christmas Shopping to finish. I told my daughters that instead of riding the bus to school, I would drive them. It was starting out to be a gorgeous day, as the sun was coming up, and the sky was absolutely beautiful and blue...not a cloud in the sky, not to mention unseasonably warm for Michigan this time of year. 
  We left our house at approximately 7:15am, and I drove my older daughter to her High School, and dropped her off. As I headed east on Saginaw Hwy, towards my younger daughters school, as we neared the intersection at Nixon Rd, we both noticed a large bright roundish white light in the north, just a few hundred feet over the woods. We turned north onto Nixon Rd, and noticed the light still there. At this time, the sky is so blue, and cloudless where we were. I drove north until we pulled into the school lot, we looked, and now the object is lower, and is over the woods directly across (west) from the school now. It just looked like a huge round whitish light in the sky. I wanted to pull over and take pictures, but the school and parking lot is so busy with traffic, and I didn't want to draw attention and have parents think I was taking pics of their kids. I watched my daughter walk into the building, and then pulled out of the lot, now heading south on Nixon Rd. At the intersection, I turned east once again onto Saginaw Hwy and headed for the I-96 freeway, which was about 3 miles form where I was at that point. I looked and the object was now gone, nowhere in sight. I looked at my cellphone clock...it was now 7:40am.
  I got onto the I-96 eastbound ramp, as I was heading for Shaheen Chevrolet in Lansing/Holt area. For a about 5 miles, I-96 eastbound actually heads in a southerly direction, until you pass the I-69 (FT. Wayne) interchange, then I-96 heads east. As I went past the I-69 interchange, I notice in the far east...ever-so-slightly north, a big solid white aircraft, like a jumbo 747 with a contrail, and it appeared to be heading west. It was just so bright white against the beautiful, clear blue sky. It was pretty to see. As I drove east, I kept watch of this aircraft. As I drove another 5 miles, this aircraft was still there, as was the contrail, and then it seemed it didn't appear to be moving. I assumed this was due to the distance away it was form me, and that it just gave the ""illusion"" it wasn't moving, since I was heading east and this was heading west. I continued to watch this aircraft the remainder of the way towards Shaheen Chevrolet. Now I was directly south of the aircraft...it still had a contrail, & that's when I noticed...the aircraft WASN'T moving. It just hung there in the sky, with this contrail behind it. I wanted to pull over immediately and take video/pictures of this, but this is NOT a safe place to just stop along the freeway at this point, because of all the exiting traffic. As I turned onto the Cedar St. exit ramp, I kept watch. This was the exit I always took to Shaheen Chevrolet/Sam's Club/Celebration Cinema Theaters/Etc. There is a stoplight at the end of this exit ramp, and it was red. As I stopped, I glanced up at the aircraft (which is just barely west of me now) and suddenly this other white object just 'appears"" out of the clear blue sky, and is under/lower the original aircraft. NOW...it too is just sitting there in the sky. 
  My husband is self-employed and his warehouse/office is located in Holt, approximately 3 miles southeast of where I was at. I quickly got on my cellphone and called him. I asked him if he was at his office...which he replied yes. I then asked him to quickly step outside and look into the north sky, and tell me what he sees. I told him to hurry. The light turned green and I am still driving at this point as this is a major intersection with many inter-connecting streets...a very high-traffic area, and I can't just pull over. As I finally get to near the dealership, I pull over into the Sam""s Club parking lot, that is adjacent to Shaheen Chevrolet and WILX TV-10 station. The aircraft is still just sitting there. My husband says he sees an aircraft...I ask him what color...and if he sees the contrail...I then ask him if he sees anything else, and I tell him to look very closely...then he sees the other whiteish object below. I then ask him if it appears to be moving, he said no, and he says it's probably just a trick of the eyes, then VERY QUICKLY I explained that I had watched this all the way from Grand Ledge, and how I too thought it was a trick of the eyes, until I got closer. Then...suddenly, the lower craft object starts moving, and quickly passes this huge aircraft. (It was like you were watching a little 4 seater plane pass a huge jumbojet...it just doesn't happen). I said...its moving now...do you see it?...he confirmed yes. I told him I had to go, as I could NOT hang onto my cell & talk and I had to quickly take pics/video....I then hung up. 
  I stepped out of my truck and tried so hard to get the video to focus, but because of the bright blue cloudless sky, and the sun, there was nothing for it to keep a good focus on and not blur. I tried everything, so I then switched it to picture mode, and managed to get 15 pictures of this. It still did not want to focus good at all, especially when I tried to zoom in on them. In 4 of the pictures, I zoomed out, so as to capture tree-tops and part of a Sam's Club parking lot light, for distance/size comparison. I could not take any more pictures, as you could no longer see them. 
  I then pulled into Shaheen, and went into the sales rep's office. While there, after a little bit, I remembering glancing at the clock, and thinking wow...time went so fast. I had so much to do, so I told him I had to get going. I didn't download the pictures 'till a few days later. When I noticed the time on the pictures.....they show the first picture taken at 8:45am..and the last picture taken at 8:47am. The entire distance from my youngest daughters school, to Shaheen Chevrolet is 13.16 miles according to Mapquest., with a driving time of 16 minutes. It shows taking M-99 exit, but I always go to the next exit (Cedar St), which is approx another 2-3 miles east. I am missing alot of time, and yet can not remember anything being out of place...besides witnessing the bright whitish objects...1 at the school, and the 1 under the large aircraft. 

What I find very odd, is the fact that I could see this large aircraft very clearly for the entire time. It was the most beautiful white against the very blue cloudless sky. I could see the wings, engines, tail section, everything. Then the smaller very bright white object appears below it...also very white, but I could NOT discern a clear definite shape/object. It looked like a very white blur/orb if you will. And the way they both just sat there in the sky, then suddenly the small object starts moving as well as the larger aircraft, and yet the small object is able to pass it, does not make sense in conventional terms, as I know them. 

I have attached 3 pics...1st is ""original"", 2nd is ""labeled"" 3rd is ""inverted colors"" (dark is light, light is dark), so you can see how even the large aircraft just doesn't seem to show hardly at all in the pics...yet this is not how my husband & I both saw it. When we saw it, it was plain as day a large aircraft, and a very white smaller blur/orb. Remember when I took these pics, the objects were now moving. You will definitely have to zoom in to see to see clearly. Also remember when I first noticed a whiteish objectin the morning, was a few minutes before I noted the time as 7:40am. The 7:40 incident was in Eaton County, the 2nd incident was in Ingham County.

My sister and I have been observing these lights throughout the summer, but only recently have we seen them nightly. They are small lights that flash white, red, and blue. Sometimes they move fast, sometimes slowly, sometimes remain stationary for extended periods. One night we saw them flying northwestward, some of them moving closer to others then moving away, then suddenly one shot directly upward and out of sight while another flew off in another direction and out of sight. On 10/23 some of the lights were stationary at various points in the sky (in a circle over Tucson) while others were flying either north or south.

Sighting occurred during the night after the passing of a severe thunderstorm in the area.

It was about two in the morning, and I couldn't sleep. My bedroom window was open and its situated on the second floor, which looks out to the South.

Lying in my bed I looked out of the window and saw a horizontal line of multi-colored lights, perhaps 7 or 8. We live within the flight pattern to Salt Lake International, and the jets normally pass overhead at about 10,000 feet. Whatever I saw was low, slow and noiseless, which I found odd.

I got up, opened the window and watched the object slowly move south, it was then joined by another similar object following it. Like I mentioned, both looked like a vertical line of lights.

I became intrigued when the first object rotated to the East and the vertical line of lights became the shape of a rounded boomerang. The second line of lights soon did the same.

I excitedly woke up my wife, she saw them as well, but remains unimpressed about the sighting.

I have a pilot's license and I'm an aviation buff, so if these were aircraft, they were something I've never seen.

We live close to a helicopter base, so it wasn't a Helo...and the new NSA center. Perhaps they were part of some special project but they definitely were not Helos, or conventional aircraft.

This is the second UFO sighting I've had in the area. The other was a couple of years before. I witnessed a massive, dark, triangle shaped object that flew over the area. The outline of which was barely discernable and it seemed to be mirroring the stars above it as you looked at the bottom of it. Soundless as well.",US,

Walking up hill after going to get some 'midnight' snacks (11.48pm was the time of the sighting), I was alerted to the UFO because whilst eating and walking up the hill I began to feel sick which was strange as we normally eat whilst walking up hill so anyway we stopped at the side of the footpath to take a break. I had my back towards town and was facing up hill, my boyfriend who I was walking with at the time was facing me so looking down towards town when suddenly he exclaimed ""OMG WHAT IS THAT!!"" 

Upon turning around to look towards town to see what he was talking about I saw a red light. At the location we were in you can see out to the hills and over the water. Above the quarry where there are always two white lights on at night time, there was a red light which was larger than the two white lights, maybe twice the size. The red light was moving in a fashion similar to a sine wave (but with a very small amplitude - so it was as if it was doing small zig zags almost but smoothly and roundly not sharp jagged movements) as well as this movement, it appeared to move further down in the sky --> so whilst moving downwards slightly it was sine wave like but only moving downwards at a tiny angle to parallel. 

I thought it was an asteroid at first as it looked like it was dropping down in the first instance that I saw it, but after a split second I noticed that it was moving as stated above in a sine wave like pattern across the sky. It appeared to move from the position it started in from around the area above signal hill right over the harbour out towards South Dunedin. It was making a very strange noise for an object its size, I say it was odd because there was NO noise, it was dead silent! my location was behind the shopping centre in the middle of town which is near the hospital so that was the second thought, is it a helicopter as there are often helicopters flying into the hospital. but NO it DID NOT make any noise, also the light was significantly larger than what you would expect from a helicopter and larger than the light of a plane(the flight path is different also, planes do not fly over that area AND the light did not stop at the hospital but continued out past it) ALSO the light was NOT flickering like plane lights do, it was red the whole time. 

After about 2mins of watching the light move across the sky, it started to decrease in size slowely (whilst still remaining lit in red light the whole time) then suddenly it appeared to pop out of the sky, disappearing quickly.It was there one minute and then completely gone the next.

For the first time my boyfriend had forgotten to bring his celephone which has an amazing camera in it, we tried to use my cellphone camera to take a pic or video BUT it is only 2Mega pixels so did not pick up anything (it was interesting to note that the lights from houses on the hill were able to be seen and the large red light / UFO was not)

I felt like I had to try and explain the event off to myself, I went through a checklist in my head, is it a plane, NO too big of a light, its not flickering and is moving at a different rate than a plane would and planes DO NOT take that flight path as the airport is not in that direction. Was it an asteroid, NO it was not dropping in the sky and was moving a lot slower than an asteroid would. Was it a helicopter, NO it was not making any noise, for an object that size it should have made a noise THERE WAS NO NOISE. Was it a laser, NO, a laser would not be able to make that size light in the sky. Was it my imagination NO boyfriend could see it too. Was it erie YES IT WAS!!! I had to pinch myself to make sure that I was not dreaming!

-After sighting the light we walked further up the hill to try and spot if we would see it from higher up. We could not. There was a fear that the light may come back closer to us so we quickly went home.

As soon as we got home, we looked it up on the web and there appears to be no other sighting of this from today,as a side note, whilst walking down the same hill, on another occasion around 2months ago at a similar time (closer to 11.20 maybe) I saw a very similar red light, it appeared above the two white lights that I described above and bobbed up and down 4-5 times and then again popped out of sight but did not diminish in size like the red light that I witnessed today (At the time I thought it must have been a person shooting flares at the quary, I went back during the day to stand at the same position on the hill and noticed that the quary was far to the right of where I had seen the light so it definitely was not flares

We had not consumed any drugs or alcohol (we were studying and took a break to get some food, event occurred whilst walking home) - Both my boyfriend and I saw the red light / UFO and thought it was very strange!!",NZ,

The second time I heard it, I got out of bed and walked outside. I looked up and saw a triangular craft with lights on each corner that looked like it was at least 400 - 500 feet up and flying at a very slow speed which looked to me to be around 60 - 70 mph. The sound it was making was so weird I can't really describe it like I heard it.

It was flying in a circle with a circumference of about 3 miles and did this for at least 20 minutes. It would fly directly over my house. I even got my video camera out and shot some video, but I don't think it will turn out since it was very dark and my camera couldn't focus on anything. At one point, there was even a different small 2 or 4 seater airplane that flew under this object at a normal speed and about 300 or so feet below the object.

It then flew in a few oblong circles until it then started to fly in a straight line away from my house at the same speed.

I was driving home past Foremark Reservoir, near Ticknall. Along Repton Road. As I approached the reservoir main entrance, I noticed a bright orange light in the direction of the water itself. This was strange to me, as it almost looked like the sun, but the sun had set some time previously and it was dark at this point. i found a place to turn around and went back to the same place where, to my surprise, the orange light was still visible. I could not see the source of the light at this point, but it looked very much like rays of sunlight glowing through the trees.

I parked my car in the lay-by that everyone uses to gain access to the reservoir and walked into the woodland, through to the car park of Foremark Reservoir itself. Hovering directly above the small island in the middle of the reservoir was a bright orange ball. To the naked eye, it appeared to be the same size an egg. With my arm stretched out directly in front of me, and my fingers measuring the object, it appeared to be around 3-4 inches in circumference. The object was roughly 300-400 feet away from me at this time and was not making any noise or movement. 

I immediately took my mobile phone out of my pocket and tried to record a video of the light. At this point, my phone (Huawei P30 Pro) froze and I was unable to open the camera. After a few seconds, I tried again and received a message saying that my phone camera had overheated and was unusable. After another 30 seconds or so, 3 or 4 smaller orange orbs slowly floated out of the bottom of the larger orb and stayed perfectly still beneath it. They then began to move towards the water, coming to a stop about 6 to 8 feet above the surface. Their glow was reflected by the water and they seemed to be lighting up the water beneath them. Each orb flashed intermittently, which lit up the whole reservoir.

After another minute or so, the smaller lights returned to the large light that was still airborne. In the time it took me to take three steps forwards, the larger orb had ascended some 100-150 feet into the air and then slowly moved to the South. It made no noise at all and moved in a perfectly straight line, without so much as a wobble or vibration. After a few seconds, this light then fell rapidly into the trees beneath. I could see the light shining through the treeline and casting shadows onto the car park.

I walked around the outside of this woodland area, staying on the road that leads out of the reservoir and observed the light for a further 2 or 3 minutes. I tried to take some photos or videos again, but my phone camera still would not work. By the time I had put my phone back into my pocket and looked back at the trees, the light was gone completely.

I rushed back to my car, as it was my intention to use my headlights to illuminate the treeline to search for an object or craft of some kind. When I tried to unlock my car, nothing happened. I pressed the button on my key numerous times and the car remained locked. After about 30 seconds of trying, the car unlocked and I was able to get inside. Once I had turned on the engine, I noticed that my headlights were not working. I turned the dial next to my steering wheel multiple times and tried to turn on the high beams, but they remained off. I then had to turn the engine off and start the ignition a further three times in order for the lights to come on.

Once I got back to the woodland area where I had seen the orange light land, and shone my lights into the trees, I was not able to see anything at all. I walked into the woods, around 30 feet or so, but could not see anything and there was no sign of disturbance or recent activity.

At this point, I left the reservoir and have not seen the light again since. 

PLEASE NOTE: I have attached a file to this report. This was the only photograph that I managed to take, using my mobile phone, during the incident. I'm not sure why it looks the way it does. The photo should show a dark night sky with a small orange light visible, which is what I was looking at at the time of taking the photo.

While on a hunting trip, I was hiking along a ridge, I stoped for a break, while I sat on rock, at aprox 6000 feet elevation, I looked strait acrossed a very big canyon, there was somthing very shiny setting on a cliffs edge, as I was looking at this, somthing appeard in the sky aprox. 1000 yards or so to the left of this shiny object, it at first looked like a black crow gliding in the sky going away from me, as I looked longer at this,only a minute or so, it seemed to be to large and to far away from me to be a bird, so out of curiosity I brought up my binoculars to take a closer look, at this point, I got a clear but only quick look, maybe 30 seconds, it appeared to be a triangler shape, a matt black in color, my first thought is that this is not a bird, as it tilted slightly to the left showing its belly side, there appeared to be a glass cock pit on the under side, toward the front, the glass to the cock pit looked very differnt almost undescribeable, there was no noise to be heard, no motors to be seen, but with a quick turn to the right it disapeared over the top of the far mountain, sitting there stunned and confused with what I just seen, and now looking across the entire distant mountain tops hopeing to maybe see it again, about 20 minutes had gone by, the shiny object was still on the cliffs edge, I noticed aprox. 1000 yards or so to the right of it on what appeard to be a flat area carved out of the cliffs edge some flickering almost like morris code, I had been looking at the shinny oject at this time in total about 40 minutes, and had not noticed any flickering before, it seemed to appear out of no where, the flickering looked like a very small mirror efect with the sun shinning on and off it, curious again, I brought up my binoculers for a closer look, the flickering was first only at one point, then aprox. 25 to 35 feet to the right more flickering, just shortly after that aprox. I am guessing 10 to 15 feet behind or above or both, there was more flickering which appeard! to be a bove the ground and not against the cliffs edge, kinda like the flickering was an outline of some sort, in fact I could not figure out how this could be possible, no spot flickered at the same time, and none the same, it very much reminded me of morris code of some sort with mirrors, but the suspended flickering was just unexplainable, no lights or noise of any kind, no pictures taken, anyway aprox. 1 hour has passed no other siting made, the flickering remained, and I got up and left.

On the evening of 11/19/2013 at around 5:30 PM CST I went outside to my front porch to observe the sky to the S and SW of my house. The weather was cool, clear, and the stars were just starting to appear. My eye immediately focused on a very large bright object about 30 degrees above the horizon to the South of me. The object appeared to be a star at first but was extremely bright, it was brighter than any other star that was out. I might ad that I have seen this object for several nights in a row and it is always in the same location. I always appears just shortly after sundown and stays out for about 1 or 2 hours then goes out. After viewing the object for about 20 minutes with my eyes I went inside and got a pair of Tasco 10x50 binoculars for a better look. When I viewed the object through the binoculars I was astonished! It appeared to be a HUGE triangle wing shaped object with 5 or 6 VERY intense white lights in the rear (engines?) and a very intense red strobe in the center on the bottom. It also had 3 very running lights. one in each corner. The surface appeared jet black like the stealth bomber. There was no noise at all. It was slowly rotating and appeared to flip on its nose and stand nose down. It emitted a bright white strobe that pulsated outward from the bottom. I noticed 2-3 other smaller bright objects at a lower altitude that appeared to be circling the main object. Also I observed at least two conventional aircraft fly over the object at a higher elevation. They appeared to be cargo planes or very large private planes. I could not make out any features on the smaller bright white object, but they never left the main object, they just circled it. I watched this go on from about 5:50 PM CST to 7:00PM CST and noticed that the main bright object was slowly descending in what appeared to be an arc-like flight path. It was moving slowly from 30 degrees azimuth to the due S (heading of 180 degrees on a compass) to treetop level in the SW (about a 220 degree compass heading)
As it was descending it would dim and brighten, then the lights appeared to go out one by one until finally it disappeared from view. The smaller objects stayed with the main triangle until it went out. I don't know if it landed or not. I might add that Fort Leonard wood Army Base is in the general direction the object was last observed and it has an airfield.",US,

Clear night, many stars visible, moon was close and bright but only 90 percent full. What I thought was a bright and low satellite (bright solid white light, no blinking) was traveling (to the west of my position) steadily from the north, southeast bound. 

I observed it for about 3 seconds (it covered 10 horizontal degrees in that time) when a much dimmer (further away looking and blue tint) object came from approximately 5-7 lateral degrees above the bright object (or above and to the west of it, from my vantage point) and changed course, following the bright objects path. The lesser object stayed about 15-20 horizontal degrees behind the bright object when the lesser object CLEARLY changed course to follow, but the bright object gained another 10 degrees between the two (either the bright object sped up or the lesser object slowed but it seemed like the former). They traveled another 20 lateral degrees south, towards the moon (just a reference point), an! d I noticed a third object (looking exactly like the lesser object) dropped down from approximately 10 lateral degrees above the bright object (which then began to travel more southeast than south) and it CLEARLY changed course to follow the bright object. The two lesser objects were close together at this point (2-5 lateral degrees between the two), obviously chasing the bright object, and all three covered about 10-15 lateral degrees before the bright object just faded out (like a fast dimming off) and the two lesser objects separated about 5 lateral degrees and, together, turned more east but still heading south until they got too far for me to see.

All three objects covered 5-10 horizontal degrees at a given time. NO blinking lights at any point from any of these objects. I believe this was low earth orbit, not in the atmosphere.

At about 22:50, the same night (sept. 4), .25 miles west of SR-17, on Merion Rd., I was looking at Ursa Major when another object that looked like the lesser objects from earlier, dropped down 10-15 degrees in about 3-5 seconds, steadily, and slowly stopped and began to blink a red light. It dropped from the furthest (from the handle) east most, top star of the pot, but barely on the inside of it, below the lowest and furthest star in the pot, stopped, began blinking the red light, lightly, and just behaved like a plane at this point, heading west slowly. It took about 20 seconds for it to travel west, below ursa major, and then appeared to stay in that vicinity. I left after about 5 minutes of keeping an eye on it but it got dimmer and dimmer so it may have been getting further from me. I was facing northwest of my position on Merion Rd.

There are always military craft out in that area, day and night, and I have come to the conclusion that the only options, of what these were, are either military and extra terrestrial, or just extraterrestrial. Unless, of course, there are private industry high altitude to space fights and chases going on. Very strange and active night. I have NEVER had such solid clarification of objects I see in the sky (that arent regular aircraft) being under immediate intelligent control. Now I know what it feels like to have actually seen something surreal in the sky.

At the top of the off ramp, looking east, there were 2 white oblong shaped objects in the sky, same height but with some distance between them. I watched them while I waited for traffic to move, thinking they were blimps but the objects never moved and seemed to be at a higher altitude than blimps fly. They just hung there for the 2-3 minutes I watched and were still there when I drove away.

At approximately 2145 I went to the veranda and looked out south over the city. In the distance, above and to the right of some unused industrial chimneys, there was a bright red-yellow light moving slowly upwards. At first I thought it was a firework and I waited for it to explode. However, it continued to moved vertically upwards and did not explode. It then slowly begun to move horizontally eastward.
The bright light was not flashing and was not point-like, but dense in the middle. It moved slowly for about 2 minutes, covering around 4 km, and then slowed until it was almost hovering. Then gradually the light dimmed to a red-brown and went out.
The sky was mostly clear, but there were a few wispy clouds; and I tried to see whether the light/object was still there, but it seemed to have disappeared. There was practically no wind. I then turned 180 degrees to go back inside my flat, when I noticed a second very bright light/object in the sky to the west. This had the exact same appearance as the first bright light. The light was very bright and was hovering. It then slowly moved horizontally towards the south, but then the light begun to fade, as had the previous bright light, and it disappeared.
I went in and thought about it, and then five minutes later came out again, and there was a third bright light as the other two, in a similar location to the second. It behaved similarly to the second light and faded out again.
There is an airport to the East, but the first light/object did not move exactly towards that and it faded out well before the airport location. The other two bright lights had no direction that could be obviously associated with the airport. 
According to the flight timetable there were no planes expected at that time. About one hour after the bright lights, there was an airplane coming in to Iasi airport; but this was very distinctly an airplane with a flashing tail light and a very different appearance to the bright lights which appeared earlier.",RO,

Shortly after 10PM, my son and I witnessed what we believe to be a UFO. I was putting my 8 year old to bed when we noticed lightning outside his window. So we sat by the open window for a moment and admired the sky in the distance while listening to the thunder. 

A minute or so went by when I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a bright star-like object moving across the sky. There were no blinking lights so I jokingly told my son it was a UFO. He looked over and the object stopped before our eyes and was hovering!! It was almost like you could see it slightly moving, but it stayed in the same spot. We gave each other this look like, are we really seeing what we think we are?! 

He then looked back out the window and the light disappeared before his eyes. I double checked to also see if it was gone, and it was but then it reappeared one more time for a few seconds then vanished again before our eyes. Afterward, we both sat there stunned for a moment and tried p! iecing together what just happened. The logical explanation is weather balloon/satellite. But my gut is telling me something different. Obviously, Im not the only one to witness such occurrences, and this isnt my first time questioning what Ive seen. I just hope whatever it is, its peaceful and just curious!

We pulled over and watched the lights light up from the bottom to the top, fading out, then sequentially lighting up in order again. After this they lit up to the right doing the same. They were perfectly still. The event lasted around 4 minutes, then we sat waiting for more and saw helicopters with search lights begin to fly in and search the surrounding areas. After waiting a bit we didn't see anymore strange lights. We began driving down the frontage road (parallel to the 10 Freeway) towards Phoenix, then saw 2 more glowing lights in the same area again. As we watched the 2 lights fade out, we spotted weird lights that we assumed were a helicopter flying towards us from Phoenix. As the flying object approached us approximately 500ft above us, traveling at a slow pace, we could only make out 2 bright white lights on the bottom, and a small pulsating blue/white light in the back.

Ive never seen anything quite like this. The lights were aligned in top-bottom arrangement, where the bottom three lights formed a triangular shape.

As they progressed further away, the second light from the bottom faded out and the bottom light seemed to move and take its place, forming three distinct lights in a line (although they seemed independent from one another and moving slightly on their own will). Then, even more amazingly, the group of lights clearly changed direction towards space! In a matter of just about a minute, they began their descent and disappeared from the naked eye.

Hi my name is Kat Clarke. I live in Aberdeen,Â Wa. I was unable to get footage. My housemate and I both witnessed what looked like a ""metallic ""-like donut shaped....thing in the sky. We have a very good view of the town from up on the hill. I found footage of another ""donut"" shaped ufo that someone posted over a week ago. Our experience happened this past weekend. I immediately got on ""Nextdoor"" to ask the local community if we were alone in these sightings.Â So far we are. It was moving really fast. And from where we are it was gone before we could process what we had seen. I'm still processing. But this video I found today looks really similar if not exact. Even the moment in rotation when it appears to be silver or something like it. Maybe reflecting the sky. It was cloudy this day also. This is crazy. Anyways...I was advised to contact you guys to make a report?.?.?

Oh and then later on in the day we saw another one...but this one stayed really low....and went behind the top of a house...again, we are almost on top of Arnold hill looking over Aberdeen Wa.

Anyways,Â weird stuff.",US,

On way to work driving 55mph, icy road conditions, very dark, no moon, no street lights. Approaching a left hand curve on Kenai Spur hwy just before fire station #2. With my car about 1500 ft from hwy curve ahead I saw a large dull burnt orange colored object out my front windshield (driver side) stationary above a treeline on north side of hwy; a few houses are scattered below the treeline. I initially thought it was an old microwave tower with its drum shaped domes (3 side by side) illiminated from below by flood lights. I thought the dull orange color was odd, and the ""3 drums"" I assumed was the top of a microwave tower looked too tight together with the middle one being the largest. I would estimate what I saw to be about 80 ft across and about 40 feet high at center. The trees below it where not illuminated by the object, it had a clear edge to it with black sky beyond, it had 3 rectangular black marks on the right side and a black vertical line going from right to left down the center. As I entered the road curve and come to about 500 ft from the object I could see it was certainly not an old microwave tower with their classic fabric covered drums. I took my eyes off it to watch the road ahead when it was just above my rear view mirror on windshield, it was about twice the size of the rear view mirror from my position looking out at it. I have driven this hwy for many years and realised no tower is at this location. I could not stop quickly due to the icy road conditions, I had to continue on thru the curve until the road straightenned out. About a minute elapsed with the object behind me and out of my sight before I could stop, turn around and drive back to site by side of hwy. While turning around on hwy to go back I could not see anything in the area it had been down the road, just dark sky and a few dull porch lights on the scattering of houses below the treeline. It was gone, I had not seen it move away. Later in the daylight I drove back and confirmed what I thought, that no tower of any kind is at the location in question; just a 100 ft wide treeline on north side of hwy with a few houses below and a small lake beyond this. I have not seen anything like this since, on my many drives to the Kenai peninsula each year. I had a camera at the time on the car seat(iPhone), but in the brief time I could have taken a shot I did not think ""UFO"" I really thought I was seeing a old microwave tower that was illuminated, very frustrating to have missed such an opportunity to say the least.",US,

I originally thought this was a helicopter with a search light on, but the red circumference of the light was definitely not a helicopter. No sound was detected. Being lake front, planes that are very high in the sky are heard quite clearly.

I was driving east on the interstate when I saw movement to the front of me, (northeast) a little left about 11:00, two objects shaped like thin crescent moons, exactly the same size and shape, going in and out of the clouds. They were situated the same, with the round part to the side and points up and down. I slowed down and stopped when they were about 11:15 in front and above me. They were bright white and the clouds were greyish. They sky between looked blue. The clouds looked like heavy storm clouds and they had a section of clear sky between them. The objects separately went into the upper cloud, then came down and went into the lower cloud. Sometimes they hovered in the clearing but they stayed in the same spot horizontally, just went vertically up and down. The objects stayed the same form of skinny crescent moon shape. I saw a plane fly over above the top cloud, going into it a bit and it looked about 1/3 the size of the objects, only horizontally lengthwise. The objects could have been closer, but the clouds looked huge, like several blocks long, and a few blocks apart, high in the sky so the objects weren't too small. At first I thought they might have been cranes or planes or something, but their shape never varied at all. It was like they were stiff objects, going slowly up and down in the clouds and out of them, between them. I often look in the sky and I am drawn to the sky by birds and clouds, but I have never seen a bird or plane that looked like this. I just watched for several minutes and tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but it said it couldn't take a photo. I don't know why, because later it would take a photo when I got home. It was disheartening that I couldn't photo it. I had never seen anything flying and shaped like that before, but I've seen orbs that moved at 90 degree angles and others that just seemed to take a straight line or that went really fast and disappeared. I've never had the good fortune of photographing them. Eventually I started my car and just drove away, looking back in the mirror for quite awhile to see if I could still see them, and I could. They were continuing to move vertically up and down as they had when I was watching them earlier. I thought they must be very large but very thin. I finally quit looking to watch the road ahead of me, but I had seen them probably 20 miles away, because I was looking for them and could still see them.

Location- sitting in my hot tub looking at the night sky in Kailua, Hawaii.
Visibility- slightly cloudy, winds 5-10 mph, half moon

Description:
A steady, singular bright light with a slightly yellow cast appeared over my head from behind, so I did not see its approach. It traveled from south/ southwest to north/ north east in a straight line for 6 seconds and disappeared beyond my ability to view because of tree cover. The light was traveling very fast, and it disappeared and reappeared in the cloud cover, as if it were flying through the clouds. The clouds were cumulus, and lit by a half moon. The light was not an airplane as it was as fast as the blue angels which I have observed and it was silent, and it was not a satellite as it was traveling across their usual path and, as described, was at a much lower altitude my estimate being around 2000- 3000 feet.

At first I thought it must be an airplane, but quickly I realized it was too low and fast, around the speed of the blue angels that perform here on occasion, and that it was a singular light was unusual. I shifted to curiosity and a sense of fun and wonder, and I wished for it to do something interesting, like an abrupt directional change as the contrails that I have observed would require. It didn't, it just flew strait and I was once again left with a feeling that there is a sense of humor at play. I had actually been asking to "" see one "" for a while now, so seeing it like this seems funny to me. I actually could even say that I feel I have a relationship with whatever is going on- whether or not that is my imagination- who knows!",US,

We pulled over off the side of hwy12 and got out of the vehicle not long after we got out the lights started moving across the the sky toward the east.another driver pulled over just in front of us and got out and started watching the object. I have no real logical explanation for what we saw it looked to be very high in the sky and massive. You could really tell the shape just a long string of close lights that were perfectly straight and moved steadily across the sky in a straight direction toward the east.we watched it until it went back behind! the hillside it was visible for a couple minutes.i tried to take videos of it but it didnt turn out my buddy got a video of it that isnt the best quality but you can see the lights.

It then stopped moving for about 20-30 seconds hovering over the north end of Loch Raven Reservoir. At that point I could see it was an oval shape object without a light.

https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/50.394/2.9795 

Sun: It was just after 20:00 and the day was pretty clear, I was traveling towards south, and the sighting happened towards east/northeast, as the train moved away. The sun was in the opposite side of the train from where I saw the UFO.

Weather: Sparse clouds with noticeable movement because of the wind.

Velocity: The train was traveling at more than 100Km/h and less than 160Km/h, judging from nearby highway traffic observed later in the trip.

Sighting: I was traveling in a seat facing the opposite direction of train movement, and first observed the object in the closest distance in the entire sighting. I noticed a white, long object (slimmer than an airliner) with an apparent size that for me at first felt like a bus- sized object.

As I was moving my point of view along with the train, the object always seemed static, staying above the same place.

No other aircraft was seem during the sighting, but later on I saw airplanes and their movement is very discernible.

As I moved away I could see only its front, round side, that reflected very well the light of the sun allowing for me to see it for more 4-5Kms. This view was partially obscured by thin clouds, so my notion of initial size can be wrong. As I moved away it became a shining white dot.

I lost sight after the train track got lower than ground level in a ditch, and made a curve toward Arras.

In Davie, Florida on Sunday December 28, 2008, my family and I were heading south on Flamingo road, just past the American Heritage Academy. Around 9:14 P.M, my brother pointed out three redish-orange, spherical objects in the sky, which we soon discovered three more to reach a total of six. 

We pulled out our digital camera, but the objects were too small to be considerably noticeable. Frantically, we pulled into the parking lot of Publix, just down that road, where we stopped and witnessed the six objects. We sat there, befuddled, trying to determine what it was. I remember rolling down my window, trying to determine if they were radio antennae.

They appeared to be slow-moving, however, it moved faster than our car, which was traveling at about 35 miles per hour. In the parking lot, another man pulled off of the same road to witness these objects.

They stopped in the sky and appeared to align themselves in regular patterns. The formation was as followed: Four lights formed a square while the other two slanted in a line below the square. They seemed to be midway in the sky, not near the horizon, but where you would expect to see radio towers. They appeared to be the size of a planet in the night sky, but smaller than the moon. From where we were standing, they looked to be about 10-30 feet in diameter.

We stood in the parking lot watching them line up and move along for about 2-3 minutes. During this time, an airplane flew below it, however, records at the Hollywood International Airport state that everything was as it shouldve been, and no special aircraft were in the air at that area or that time. The quantity and formation of the lights changed, however, the color did not. They seemed to be heading west, towards the Florida Everglades. After the experience, I noticed a faint ringing in my left ear on my way home which soon subsided.

While driving to work this morning at 7:45 AM on the west side Mississippi River Road North, which paralles the Mississippi River and it's levee; Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what was thought at first to be a flock of large birds flying in a V formation, not an uncommon sight in this area. Upon looking directly at it, I saw an object which had a definate triangular shape, but transparent, with a watery, wavy appearance, like heat waves seen on the highway from a distance. The outer ""frame"" of the object appeared more prodominate that its' interior. The weather here has been rainy for the last 24 hours, the atmosphere, although not foggy, was heavy with humidity and misting rain. I observed the object fly in a silent sweeping motion across the sky, in an easterly direction from a sugar cane field across the River Road, across the levee and out of sight. It's altitude was approximately 100 feet, its speed was approximately 80-90 mph. It's size was approximately that of a midsized passenger airplane. I'm guessing about it's size, altitude and speed, however, it was plainly visable, although transparent, ""a clear mercury look"" . I even blinked my eyes thinking that I was seeing ""spots"", the object was still there.

I went outside my apt. and it was overcast. Looking up I saw a glowing orb, going counter clockwise almost directly overhead. It was north of my position. This was at appx. 2300. I went out thinking it was perhaps someone shinning a flashlite which was reflecting off the cloud cover so I moved toward it, it moved away from me cont in a northward manner. I had a large magnum flashlight which I shot upwards to see if it was something like that, but my beam did not produce any reflection off the clouds.

I turned and moved back to my apt and was going to get in my car to drive out on the street to see if I could locate the source. Thought it could be a saleslite.

However, there was no beam from the ground up, and this orb looked as if it were behind the clouds. As I drove out, another person drove in, I stopped and asked this person if she knew what that lite was. She told me it had been seen at Atascadero State Hospital (which I live next to) from the courtyard all night and no one could figure out what it was. She remarked on how fast it was going, I also asked if it appeared to her that it was moving somewhat jerkily, she agreed.

At 23;30 it suddenly disappeared. I drove out to see if I could tell where it was coming from, there is a new blockbuster but it is not close to this area, and the orb was centered over where I live. Blockbuster shut down at ten pm. I drove there but could not see any of the equipment used for producing a saleslight. I will have to go in and ask them if they had a sale lite up, but if they closed at ten pm and it went off at 23;00 there should have been someone there taking the light down and I went right over and the place was locked up with no sign of anyone.

I have seen several UFO's in this area this week, also have two other people in another part of town. This is a samll town, it was very strange to see this orb and it moved very fast in a counter-clockwise motion with no light coming up from the ground. I only saw it short time, if I had not stopped to ask this person if they could id the light for me I would not have known it had been viewed for several hours from the State Hospital. Cannot firgure out where or what it was. Silent also.

((NUFORC Note: If the object was viewed for 5-6 hours, we doubt that it was a UFO. PD))

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Glowing orb moving counter-clockwise very fast veiwed my several witness in different locations

This is in regard to earlier filed report I made of glowing orb seen in clounds above my apt in Atascadero, California. I called the police of Atascadero and reported my sighting and asked if they had recieved any calls of a similiar type. The dispatcher said that at about seven pm they had recieved a call from Templetom reporting the same object. The Dispatcher said no police on patrol during the evening saw this orb. Clound cover was about 500 feet. Templeton is located about 6 miles north of Atascadero.

As we neared the end of our walk I looked up to the NNW sky and noticed a ""string"" of five lighted objects somewhat higher than the usual jet path, they were about equally spaced and at that height I can't say how far apart but moving faster than the usual jets I track. They moved from NNW to NNE but that's not all! More and more kept coming out of the NNW, a string of 11 then a string of five again but widely separated and even more largely spaced apart and some in groups again!

Was in my back yard last night around 10:45 and saw a far-off object and just kept my eye on it because I thought it might be a satellite and wanted to watch it go by. It was going really fast, faster than the satellites and faster than the airplanes that come by my home. It also was much lower than a satellite or plane. Looked for blinking lights on an airplane and there were none.

As it came within clear view, my mouth dropped open it was a glowing greenish yellow and I immediately thought about the glowsticks that kids use at Halloween. The shape was really odd, not seemingly aerodynamic at all - it was rounded and I feel like it had two rounded parts hooked together not discs though. It was completely silent and very big and much lower in the sky than even the small airplanes.

I took two steps out further into my yard when it got the closest to me so I wouldnt lose sight of it as it went by and it disappeared. Either the lights went completely dark or it actually disappeared.

When we were going back to the house I asked if the others saw anything in the sky that they noticed. The 2 others said they saw what I saw.

The lights weren't lightning bugs, these shot across the whole sky quick and
made 90 degree turns up or down while streaking!!!!

We saw about 4 or 5 in different directions and it lasted about 4 minutes
then they shot out of sight.

We weren't scared but sure as hell were surprised!!!!!

But the satellite changed direction, then my eyes adjusted to the darkness and I realized there were 2 lights in perfect unison moving in the same directions. When I focused even closer I noticed what was a very large, matte black figure shaped like an ""L"" or maybe a boomerang. It was a perfect geometric figure with two white, unblinking lights on each end, slowly moving/hovering above where we stood. NO sound came from this thing, no other lights or blinking anything that might suggest it was a plane. It was too close to earth, and VERY large, making a 'beeline' or figure 8 above our heads. I yelled out to my boyfriend and asked ""What the hell is that?!"" and pointed at it, he looked and said ""Huh, It's a UFO!"" At that point I freaked out and ran inside.

The craft looked identical to saucers that have been drawn or fotografed before. It was night but we could clearly see its dome shape siluate and bottom because of the light of the city.

My kids noticed many blue colored windows.

I was about 12 at that time. A friend of mine and I decided to continue practice softball after everyone had left. I hit a high ball and as I watch it I noticed six spheres flying in formation. Told my friend to look up and he and I watched them for about 2 minutes. It was a arc'd flight in the vacinity of Fort Lewis. They were in formation as one then two and again one then two. Based on the size and distance away and because McCord Airforce Base was close by, I now estimate the size to be that of a Boeing 747. When we ran home we turned on the radio to a talk show and they said that over 100 people had called in asking if the Air Force was testing a new type of flying vehicle.

In 1957 when I had returned home from a date, I glaced to the northern sky overlooking Tacoma and noticed a disk shaped object the size of a Boeing 727 flying over Tacoma in and out of clouds. This lasted about 30 seconds due to the cloud cover. No noize and the object was metallic with what looked like windows around the perimeter of the DISK.

IN 1965 I student taught in Bellingham, Washington. In a science class I mentioned the fact that I did see a UFO once. An indian boy of age 14 came to me later because he did not want to be ridiculed and told me of an incident when he viewed a UFO hover overhead and then take off directly upwards at high speeds.

In 1968 I was a system engineer at Boeing after finding out how little teachers get payed since I also had a degree in Physics. I was in a car pool. I mentioned once that I had seen a UFO and one of the other fellows remarked that he had seen a cigar shape UFO once.

In 1969 I was a manager of system development at Boeing and one of my employees told me during lunch that when he was traveling to California from Washington, six USO flew overhead and caused some interference such that the cars on the freeway stalled out.

In 1980 as manager of On Line Systems for an insurance company in Galveston, Tx.

I again mentioned the fact that I did experence seeing a UFO and one of the staff members said that he say a small sphere flying around his neighborhood in a northern state (don't remember which one.) In 1981 again at lunch I mentioned something about UFO's and computer operator overheard what I had said and talked to me in primvate saying that he say a disk shape UFO ffying over the causeway one day when he was coming to work.

In 2004 while downloading a large file, I stumbled onto your web site and noticed that we are the only ones that have seen it.

I sometime wonder if the Star of Bethlaham seen by the wisemen when Jesus was born was not a UFO sent to this planet in recognition of a highly significant event, Since the Star could not really be a star as described.

It was silent, moving slowly across the sky hugging the tree tops. So close to us! It almost looked like a ball of fire with a white light in the middle on the bottom. 

The lights were pulsing. It kept sowly traveling away from us until out of sight. It was not fireworks! Not a plane! This was something we had never seen before!

Looking out my kitchen window as the sun was setting I see a majority of airplanes approaching CVG to land, and even see planes pass by way up in the sky. My family are a bunch of pilots and I have been taught by them how to identify aircraft in the sky.

Around 8:40pm looking out I noticed a group of birds flying just above the horzion and above a tall tree, so I can imagine the birds were about 80 to 200 feet above. As soon as I watched the birds fluttering up and down heading from left to right across my window I noticed another object about the same size as the birds from my distance, but it didn't flutter. It went really fast, faster than any bird and it kept very straight and steady. And it seemed to be just above the birds, but as quick as it was I really couln't tell the distance from the object to the ground. I would say it lasted between 10 seconds to 20 seconds that I saw it. By that time the object has disappeared out of my sight and the birds were still just making it barely to the half way point of my vision from my window. The object passed the whole window, so I can use that as a measuring tool. The speed astounded me, because it was unreal. When airplanes approach or fly over, you hear them from inside my house. There was no noise from the craft. No sonic boom, nothing! Note airplanes you can make out a shape because they are not that fast to the point that you can't tell its an airplane. Everyone knows this. Of course it could be the airforce, but then there would of been some sonic boom or some noise. I wonder if anyone else noticed this object. Lastly, there were planes in the sky above, and they definitly could not compare to the unidentified object that I saw, meaning there was clearly something unusual about what i saw compared to a cesna, 747, 737, 777, or any other commericial and non commerical aircraft.

Since then I've been out numerous times(to no avail)to see them again. I always take a camera when I am out at night. I had gone to the top of a butte behind town to see the lunar eclipse, and I saw the lights again. I am terrible at judging distance at night, and so I can't judge the size of things either. I was able to figure out later that they were at least 10 miles away. That would make them good sized. 

The lights are a golden-orange. At first there were two,due south and they were blinking on and off in unison. Then another came on to the southwest. I was able to zoom in enough with my lens to get some photos and video. What I couldn't see with my eyes was a dimmer red-orange light that stayed on and would only change brightness slightly.

I was driving south bound on the overpass near Gila Bend, when I noticed an object hovering on the right hand side of my car, I was immediately drawn to the object, due to its unfamiliarity. I took direct notice of the stars and realized it was not a planet, star, or satellite. The object stood stationary as I pulled off to the side of the road to analyze it further. There were no buildings, lamp posts or any object near the sphere, which was a bright orange/red in coloring. I had my camera near me, for earlier I had taken some landscape photos while on my drive. I lifted my camera to the object and the object began to move, I captured a movement picture of the object, I could not quite get a clear picture so I switched my camera to video mode. The object then began moving drastically as if trying to avoid being captured on film. The object darts drastically in my video, and the camera starts making noises with every movement of the object, and an interaction between the two is obvious, which is also captured on the video, you can also see rings in the object with an almost nucleus center. I then lowered my camera to grab another photo and while switching over the camera the object separated into multiple spheres now white in color, the spheres were in two lines, the spheres from right to left glowed and pulsed out light with greater intensity one at a time, when the the last sphere pulsed with light the spheres joined from right to left and formed back into one to disappear at a phenomenal speed. When zooming in on the photo of the object multiples of colors can be viewed.Like I mentioned before, I have video footage of what I have described but I'm not to positive of how to send video via internet.If somebody could get back to me and explain how to do so, I'd be happy to send over the footage.

Looking North I saw 3 flashing lights. Would appear far from each other then w/in a sec 4 to 5 to 6 lights would show up very close together. 

I did call 12 News in Phoenix and spoke w/ a Paul Martinez, but he had said, ""sorry can't help u with what you're seeing, sorry, bye."" (So I was very annoyed by that, cause who else would i contact at the news if not calling their main line, right?!?!) You would think he'd ask for what I was seeing, the direction, etc, just like previous people have done in the past here. 

So anyways, after calling it did look like 3 jets scrambled to the direction east that I said it was going where we lived, (not knowing why and they were loud) but not moving as fast as I saw the first 3-6 very odd looking lights blinking, which the jets didn't have the same pulsing or blinking of the lights I had seen w/ the previous that just flown by moments earlier. 

Then w/in an hour I saw again moving east to west this time the same white ! flashing lights moving erratically go from 3 lights, then to 4, 5, and then 6 flashing lights w/ no noise. They went as far West as I could see over the mountains towards Prescott, AZ. 

Then they'd go north to south north to south for about 3 min but it looked like north to south was like 1-2 miles from where I was. They weren't moving faster than I've seen jets before move and would move around up down side to side. Then back my way 15-20 miles, maybe even 30 miles from my balcony within a blink of an eye without any noises being heard. I've also have seen this same thing tonight, Wed, Oct 23, 2013, as well.

In the early morning of July 30th 2018 around 0320, as I laid down to bed, I noticed a particularly bright star in the Southern sky, to the right and lower than the moon. I thought nothing of it, except it was pretty, but when I looked at it after taking my glasses off it seemed to be emitting symbols of some kind. I put my glasses back on and no longer saw anything aside from the star. I did this several times, and then decided I had to get up and try to video it on my cell phone. My recording does not show any symbols, but it does show a ""star"" that doubles to two and makes circles, squares, and triangle shapes. I watched it for at least 20 minutes, recording it twice - the first recording that is about 3 minutes is pretty shaky because I've never videoed anything at night. The second recording, about double the time, is steadier. When I watched the videos the next day, I still did not see any symbols, but when I enlarged it on my phone with my fingers it shows the ""star"" changing into two and varying between circles, squares, and triangles. I submitted it to another ufo on-line website but they stated they only saw a ""tiny, light-colored speck of light"" so I wanted to get your opinion on it. I don't think they were able to enlarge it like I can on my phone. Please take a look if you could and provide me with a second opinion?

I was sitting on my rear deck at my home approximately 9 PM on June 10, 2006. Im sorry I do not remember the exact date. There was no one else home at the time. My son was out for the evening. It was very quiet and peaceful outside and I was enjoying the evening. There were no children playing or any adults that I could hear or see. I did not have any lights on outside but there was a little light shining out from my kitchen. I was looking up at the night sky and looked to my left which would be a northeastern direction over my neighbors roof and I saw what I thought was a plane but there was no sound. It appeared to be a small bright headlight, even though planes usually have two, and was steadily and slowly approaching as it was getting larger. We have an airport located not very far away and see a lot of planes coming and going. However, that night I did not hear or see any planes before, during or after the event. The path it was traveling in was coming directly towards me so I continued to watch it and as it got closer I realized it was not a plane and the bright headlight was really brilliant white flames. For a moment I thought it might be a balloon slowly descending but there was no balloon. Instead there appeared to be what looked like an upside down white Styrofoam cup type object. The flames were the brightest white Ive ever seen. They were at such an angle that they were dominant and almost obscured the object behind them until it got closer. The flames were shooting out and flickering and I couldnt take my eyes off of it. I felt a little panicky as it came closer to me and decided if it got too close I would run in the house. It kept coming closer and I was about to run when it abruptly went to the left without turning or changing its position. It was still facing me but moving left. It was moving at a quick pace and for some reason I was no longer afraid probably because it was going away from me. I ran after it out to my front yard wall as far as I could go and watched as it continued in the same direction and getting smaller as it traveled. It then suddenly ascended, not straight up, but at an angle in a northern direction and kept climbing until I could no longer see it. I was wishing there was someone out and about that I could have asked if they saw what I had seen but the streets were quiet and empty. I told my son as soon as he got home and he never doubted what I saw. He just wished he had seen it too. However, when I went to work the next day and told the people I ate lunch with, I was laughed at and even called a liar by one of them. I couldnt believe their reaction. I thought they were my friends. So Ive kept it to myself for all these years but Ive always wondered if anyone else has ever seen the same thing I have. So I decided to get in touch with you. Ive watched many episodes about UFOs but have not seen anything like it as yet. I would love to hear from you if there are any other reports like this.

On October 22, at approximately 7:40PM Central standard time, we saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) over our home in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.

We were having a campfire in our backyard and I was looking up at the clear, starry sky as we often do. I stood up to warm myself by the fire and continued to look up at the sky. About a minute after I stood up, I noticed something strange coming from the west over the trees in our neighbors yard. When it went over the pine tree in our yard, I said something like ""what is that?"", and my wife and daughter began to look for it. My wife suggested it might be a meteoroid as there was a shower expected, but then she saw it as well and knew it wasn't a meteoroid. Shortly thereafter, my daughter saw it as well, and they both saw it long enough to identify it in a way similar to what I was seeing.

The best way I've come up with to describe it is like this: Imagine the night sky reflected in a still, dark pond. Now imagine dropping a single pebble into this pond and how the waves created alter the reflection of the sky. The UFO looked like a single one of these waves, but cut into an arc of about 1/4 of a circle, slightly pointed at the center of the leading edge. As it moved across the sky, it obscured the stars causing a small amount of refraction, with only the leading edge clearly visible. I'm not sure if the leading edges visibility was due to it emitting or reflecting light, or if it was just a more intense distortion of the night sky.

The objects speed and direction was constant, and it moved silently.

It's hard to judge the altitude and therefore the size of the object, but it was at least 200 feet above the ground because it was above the trees. If it was only that high up, then it was approximately 16 feet across from wingtip to wingtip. The total time the object was visible to me was about 8-10 seconds, in which time it traveled from behind my neighbors trees to behind our house as it moved west to east. This is a distance of about 50 yards. Jamie and Libby picked up the object as it was about half-way through this path.

At first I thought it was an optical illusion, a problem with my vision or perhaps due to me standing up too fast. I also considered that it could be related to smoke or heat from the campfire. However my family's observations, and in particular their descriptions matching what I saw (before I described it myself) ruled-out a problem with my vision as the explanation. The other explanations (smoke, heat) didn't make sense as we continued to see the object long after it was beyond the range of these local effects.

Other possibilities we considered were animals. The general shape was not unlike the V formation birds fly in, but you don't usually see flocks of birds flying at night, and the shape was too smooth to be made up of group of birds. Also, the effect it had on the starlight isn't something that would be created by flying animals that I'm familiar with.

I'm familiar with most civil and military aircraft, and the shape, speed and translucency of the object was unfamiliar to me. The fact that it was silent would indicate that it was either unpowered, or so far away as to be unheard (which would indicate that the object was of gigantic proportions). Experimental aircraft may be an explanation as we frequently spot military aircraft flying nearby, and we also live less than an hour from the Oshkosh airport, home of the Experimental Aircraft Association.

At this point a clear identification or explanation isn't available. The most rational explanation I can come up with is that it was some kind of cloaked/stealth glider, using one of the recently described optical cloaking mechanisms. This would explain the shape, motion and visible signature of the object as well as its silent flight. That said I've never heard of such a vehicle, and if it were a glider it would have had to have been dropped from an aircraft as there are no natural high elevation points nearby. It would have also presumably landed within a few square miles, and so far I haven't heard any other reports of the object being sighted in the city of Beaver Dam.

There may be other environmental explanations as well. Being a clear, cold night I'm not aware of any such explanation but I'm hoping that by sharing this story others with more knowledge of the subject can contribute additional possible explanations.

So a friend of mine with the name of ((girl's name deleted)) and myself were travelling from NJ to DE for a wedding reception for one of her family members next day. I cannot remember which road we were taking as she was driving but it was one of the main ones as I remember paying toll shortly after. I believe it had 9 in the number so it was on 495 or 295, but I remember it wasn't 95.

So there she was driving and it was past 2:30 am and I reclined the passenger seat and I was trying to get some sleep. Then she pokes me to wake me up saying: ""((male name deleted)) wake up there is a UFO next to the car!"" and she had a nervous laughter to her voice and she said that twice. Now my first impression was that she just wanted to wake me up so I can keep her company so I pretended I was fast asleep till the second poke.

I turn to her (as I was sleeping facing my door) and I ask her ok where is it? Now she used to make fun of my belief in UFOs, so I couldn't have taken anything coming from her about that matter seriously.

She points to some lights outside her window that seemed a few miles away at least. They appeared to be a row of round white lights at least 6-7, reminded me of portholes of a ship with lights shining from inside now that I think about it. Any ways these lights were many feet above the ground but it's so hard to tell how far they were, we were going through a flat area with no street lights or houses, possibly fields. I automatically looked for scientific explanation for what we were looking at, I said may be it's a construction tool/crane of some sort or row of lights on a building.

But we continued to drive further and we DID NOT leave the lights behind which can only mean they were not stationary and keeping pace with our speed! I asked her how long has it been since she first saw the lights and she said a few minutes! I asked her to stop the car and the lights may have just stopped if they were following us. So now I see the lights stationary/hovering in the air with absolutely no sound and I had this feeling that something intelligent was looking at me while I was looking at it/them. Few seconds after, the row of lights moved together (which confirmed to me that they were attached to the same object and not individual) from being horizontal to being suspended in the air at about 20 degrees! The craziest thing I have seen is as it started to tilt from flat to 20 degrees, it ""wobbled"" like it was in water not in air! Reminds me if you have a bathtub of water and gently drop a plate how it will land at the bottom. It was bigger than plane f! or sure but I could not confirm what it looked like, I thought I could see a black silhouette of the body which I thought it was flat but I am not 100% sure. It was dark with no lights around but these.

I had the hairs on my body stand on end and it then hit me that that WAS NOT EARTHLY! It immediately reminded me of the Phoenix lights which I saw briefly in 1997 on the news with the volume down and never got the whole scoop on it. I cannot explain to you how it just hit me that I am witnessing something out of this world and how different it was between believing and witnessing! I had a 35mm camera behind my feet as we wanted to take pictures next day at the reception and I frantically was looking for it under the mess of the empty fast food wrappers and I was about ready to leave the car to take a snap (I thought I will make history and all) she grabs my left arm and said: ""They will take you with them!"" and until this day I cannot believe what I said in response.. ""I want to go with them!"".

Whomever is reading this, at that particular moment I was ready to leave EVERYTHING and EVERYONE on earth to experience for myself that we are not alone, even if I couldn't come back EVER! Any ways I took note of the time on the dashboard which was 2:50 am.

I get out of the car go around the back, got the camera ready and this thing tilts and wobbles again just like it did before so now it's at 45 degrees suspended in the air with no sound. And then.. NOTHING! It just disappeared! I thought I may have missed it take off but I am very positive that it just was no longer there! It was like when you turn off the lights in a room kind of effect! So here I am on the side of the highway with a camera loaded with film, mouth wide open and looking at nothing! I went back to the car and looked at the time and there was none missing, we drove further down hoping to find it again if it has just moved further down but there was nothing! We paid toll and kept on going but there was nothing.

Next day, we told her parents and they kinda chuckled, but didn't call us crazy. It's funny that there is a ufo shaped house in DE we used to often pass and I wonder what's the story behind that? I am willing to undergo any kind of test to the truth of my encounter and I was not under the influence of any mind altering substance. I am a doctor by background and I believe in evidence not stories.

I watched them for about a hour with my boyfriend then I went to bed and another apeared in view and did the same thing except it would go really fast up in the air and then drop back down and do circles to and s shapes. I finally fell asleep. They were far away enough that when they stood still you would think they were stars. Its going to be clear tonight so I'm going to see if they are still there or see if the stars are there? I have never seen anything like it and I've seen shooting star but not ones that go down and come back. Also I've seen satilites but they usually keep moving slowly across the sky. So I really don't know what I saw.

We were a group of hikers camping at 14,000' on the Marcahuasi Plateau located northeast of Lima on the eastern ridge of the Andes. Just after the sun set, around 7:00 pm we witnessed 14 to 16 luminous sphere like objects in the sky for one hour. They would slowly fly across the sky, change direction and then reappear in another portion of the sky altogether. At one point a sphere ""flashed"" us appearing to have increaded tremendously in size briefly in an intense flash. We were able to clearly discern these objects from other meteor ""shooting stars"" that evening which were occasionally present as well. This event took place in a clear night sky without the moon, which rose hours later. The ""flash"" occured when I directed a question internally whether this could be my imagination. A few of the individuals in the group had other sightings but most of the group had never seen anything like this before. It was an entirely fascinating and extraordinary event which covered three days in total as one person in the grop had a contact experience the night before in the high andean village we stayed at before the ascent to the plateau, and again the following two nights on the mountain. We later learned of another group near Mt. Adams (Washington State), witnessed by reporter Michael Miley of UFO Magazine, had a sighting similar to our on the following days of May 23 and 24. Both sightings were witnessed by numerous individuals.

I was driving home from Leicester to a village where my family live. It was about 3:30 am. I stopped at traffic lights. My attention was then caught by a formation of 3 lights flying about 1000 metres up, and about a mile away. The lights then moved towards the car, nearly overhead. There was no noticable noise. Suddenly a new light pulsed once slowly and then shone. This light was three times the size of the others and in the middle of the formation. It was also lighter on the outside than the inside. The object sped away at speed???? Perhaps it was moving at speed anyway. I could not tell whether they were changing altitude, growing???? or just gaining speed. It was very jerky movement. I moved my head over the steering wheel to get a better look. The lights disappeared from my view. I could not see much out of the back window so i could not see it. I continued home. This must have been seen by others as there was a car behind me at the Traffic lights.

About two hours later, we were sitting on our front porch. Very bright lights appeared through the trees in our front yard. My wife said to me that a plane was about to crash in front of our house. We ran out to the street in a panic. There was a huge silver craft,that was covered in flashing lights. the lights were flashing every color in the rainbow. The object was hovering about as high as the treetops, very slowly moving toward the north. My wife and I were awestruck. The object was large, about the mass of city bus, but sort of disc shaped. We watched the object for about twenty minutes, then it suddenly lit up bright white. It shone a huge white beam down toward us. We were so frightened that we ran in our house and hid for the rest of the night. We have witnessed these same objects on three other occasions. on another night, we followed an object that looked exactly the same for about three miles. it was moving about thirty miles an hour, just above the treetops. It turned and started coming at us. We ran from it. It was obviously following us, so we just kept driving. I was watching the sky as we drove, there were dozens more of them flying low. I counted fifteen of them, and there were a lot more than that. We drove for forty miles, while they followed us. We have observed these objects many times.

((NUFORC Note: We suspect that report is a hoax. Date is flawed, and source has failed to respond to our e-mailed messages. We have changed the date. PD))

At about 22:45 in Bothell, WA, I was on my back deck and saw numerous objects (I believe 6) fly overhead. They had no lights but were clearly visible I'm assuming due to the city lights below. They looked silverish-gray but that is probably the city light reflecting off them. They were in a ""V"" formation. One in front, two directly behind the first, and 3 behind the two. The row with three, the one on the far right was off centered however. Appeared to be pulling away from the others but I can't be sure as I only saw the objects for a few seconds before they went over the tree line. There was no sound at all. I cannot give an exact altitude but I'm guessing 1000-2000 feet due to the speed across the sky. Basically west to East. If they were at 10,000 feet they would have been the size of jumbo jets and going at least mach 4 or 5 so my assumption is much lower altitude. Again, no sound at all which is not possible if it was a low-flying (or high flying) formation of jets. I cannot guarantee they were separate objects as it's a pitch black night sky, but it appeared they were, as one was out of formation. My first thought was maybe a big drone but the speed was too fast and the off-centeredness does not make sense. I'm sure others saw what I saw too as it's a populated area. Very strange and never seen anything like it.

Sorry it was 9/20. A few hours before I sent the email. I live by an International airport and within 25 miles of two Boeing airports so I see a lot of aircraft flying around. Also seen Blue Angels many of times and it did look like an Angel formation, very close together.

He drove towards the star-like lights that were assembled in a straight line. He arrived at Dixie Mart and went in. he came out with another patron and showed that person the lights. Both observed the lights for a few moments until they began to move. He drove back home, about 1.25 miles and got my daughter out of the house and several neighbors to see what he was seeing. I received a phone call to come see the objects at about 2145 hours and to pull into the yard with my lights off. I did not know what I was being called to their house for.

I quickly drove to their house 100 yards away and got out with my wife. My daughter and her fiance both pointed to the south by south-eastern sky. They were with several neighbors all looking at the lights. I personally saw two or three extremely fast pulsating lights that were too far away to judge the distance. One of the objects went under the clouds the other two disappeared into the night sky.

She said she had been watching this object for about 10 minutes before she realized this was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter or anything like that. I looked out the window to the Southeast, and observed a large white glowing sphere....not really moving at this point. After watching it for a minute or two, I quickly dismissed it as just a bright star. I was about to call my wife crazy and return to bed when the sphere suddenly started moving around in an elliptical circle EXTREMELY fast.

I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one's lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn't know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn't show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don't believe it was alien, but then again I don't have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you.

My nabor hears me yelling at my father ""Get out here if you want to see something very cool""

Neighbor rushes out as well just in time to see the Object after it passed over head. Object Moving FROM West South West Toward East North East. Object Moved about 10 Miles and began to get smaller. And I do NOT mean smaller as in because it was getting farther away thus appeared smaller. I mean as in the light or object was actually getting smaller and smaller till a point at which its smallest it turns Red and then Vanished. DID NOT Vanish because it went out of sight it Vanished because the Light slowly faded down, turns red and then turns off. 

I woudl have thought it looked like a re entry except NO Tail nor any red color from Heat. 

Another Possibility My father brought Up was perhaps a space station reflecting the sunlight as it got farther over Earth, earth blocking the sunlight the light fades away. So it woudl be a good idea to research the path of orbit of the space station and see if it is consistant with this sighting. Also was it over Hawaii during this time and Date. 

However I saw Two Sattlights moments after the Object on an orbit from South to North and both of them clearly In Orbit Looked Hundreds of times farther Upward than this Object. This Object appeared to be Right over head. As I said looked to me like it was between 3 and 6 thousand feet up no More. 

Its possible it was a Re Entry of some Kind. This would explain the Light being so bright and then faiding away. Though I want to make clear over the 10 Mile Path the light did not faid one single bit. It only began to faid after the end of the 10 Miles. Once It began to faid it was only seconds till it went red and then out completely. 

If this was a Re Entry I would wonder why an Object woudl be re Entering Earth Right Over Maui. 

I sure would like to see some research into the Possibilities such as the Path of the Space station to conferm or eliminate that theory. Ect..

This report is being filed decades after the purported event occured and it is additionally being filed by me as a third hand account.

As near as I can presently figure, some time in the early to mid 1970's, my Aunt was having a phone conversation with my father whom was at his home several miles away, when suddenly she stopped talking, gasped and then stated something to the effect of, Oh, my God I just saw a cigar shaped thing out my window. After her initial shock and upon regaining her composure she attempted to further describe what she saw and what course of action the object she viewed had done.

To the best of my recollection and again the following is admittedly classified third-hand information, she advised my father that what she saw was rather long 2 - 300 feet in length. She also stated that it travelled from the South to the North and from her perspective, likely directly over the Hudson River which is approximately one half a mile East of her home, in North Albany about 3/4 of a mile from Albany's boundry line with Menands, New York to the North. 

Unfortunately every family member from that generation has passed and therefore I am unable to secure any more info. I believe, dozens or more other people also saw the object, however as of this writing, I haven't attempted to confirm this information.

It was huge. It had a shape. I ran inside and grabbed my phone and snapped a few shots. I also manipulated a couple of them and brought out what looks like a cigar shaped aircraft but also it resembled a saucer. (you'll see what I mean) It looks like it has dimension. I took a few close ups and a couple of wide angles. The sun's light is reflecting off of something cloaked in the clouds to the right of the sun. I have to say I1m kind of freaked right now. I also caught a secondary object that looks geometrical with antennae protruding from the corners. I drew circles around the objects and I'm sure you'll be able to identify the bright object when you view the photographs. Also, the smaller darker object wasn't seen until I blew up the photographs. It's only in one frame. It is geometrical in shape and appears to have small antenna protruding from the corners. Also, you can see circles on the secondary object that could be windows or mirrors like on a telescope or camera. After a while of looking at it my eyes kinda teared. It was like looking at a little sun. The shape evaporated into the surrounding clouds after about 5 minutes.",US,

We live on the east side of a lake in northern Columbia County in New York State. From where we are located, we have an unobstructed view of the western sky. On the night of Saturday August 28, 2010, the skies were clear with temps in the low 70's.

At about 9:25 that evening, I went outside to get something out of my truck. We had been cooking and canning vegetables from our garden all day, and the house was quite warm inside. Noticing how pleasantly cool it was outside, I asked my girlfriend if she might like to come outside for a while to cool off.

As we stood down by the water, chatting and looking at the house lights from across the lake, something caught my eye in the west northwestern night sky. 

At an elevation of about fifty degrees, a bright white star-like object had suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.

Had this object been stationary, and not as bright, I might have mistaken it for just a large star. But it was not stationary. It was moving in a northerly direction at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed.

After about three or four seconds from the time it first appeared, it executed a very tight, almost flat, 180 degree turn to the south, and after proceeding in this new direction for another three or four seconds, it just as suddenly seemed to ""turn off"" again, just like someone turning off a light switch, and became invisible to our eyes once more in the night sky.

Please understand that when I used the word ""turn"", I am not speaking of any kind of a turn in the conventional way. This object, whatever it was, had managed to accomplish a complete and opposite change of direction in less than a second. It's speed remained constant throughout the entire manuver, and it's motion can only be described as ""fluid"".

As we stood there in silence for perhaps fifteen seconds or so, trying to comprehend what this actually was that we had just witnessed, another bright white ""star"" ""turned on"" in the west southwestern sky.

I took this to be the same object that we had seen before, as the size and light intensity were the same, as was it's elevation above the horizon.

This time however, the same manuver that we had just witnessed was being repeated in reverse, with the object making another of those ""impossible"" 180 degree turns, and heading back to the north again before ""turning off"" once more.

We stood there for several more minutes watching the sky, but it did not reappear again.",US,

It seems very clear they are orbs, not plans, their movement is nothing like plans and they disappear all at once. At first I thought they were speeding up the film time and they were plans landing, but why did they all disappear at one time. The pattern they were flying did not seem like plans at all.

Furthermore, its speed was constantly changing: speeding, and the slowing (to nearly a halt). It then proceeded to deviate from its original apparent orbital path, heading more South, rather than East (as originally). It began fading and varying in its luminosity. In a clear sky. Now, extremely attentive, I watched as it totally faded from the sky. Only to reappear to the far south, in a span of seconds - much too short for that of a satellite to travel within - Not to mention it was heading a completely different path by this point.

The stadium lights of Marana High School were on and the amber lights appeared to be to the north and further away than the stadium lights, which were about 3 miles from us. The two separate sets of amber lights were in a line or gentle arc, and each of the two sets consisted of three or more lights. The lights were not especially bright.

But know that I have read about abductions, I know it wasn't ghosts. I was looking for my parents, and I realised that they must have gone out ito the yard.

I walked into the kitchen, and saw that the wall in front of me was rippling like water after you drop a pebble into it. I watched this for about three seconds before the wall totally dematerialised. I walked into the room beyond the hole in the wall, and my mind seemed to slow down - everything slowed down, and the walls, the ceiling, the floor, every surface in the room was covered with wooden floorboards.

I turned to look and noticed it was not falling at all but traveling parallel to the ground. Then I noticed it was actually 2 objects evenly spaced apart, travelling at the exact same speed. Their distance never changed, they were in perfect sync. They were too high to be birds and too low to be planes.

I then noticed they looked like white triangles. There were no lights on them. They made no sound at all.

I thought they might be birds, but they flew in a perfectly straight path at pretty fast speed and the distance between them never changed. The precision was perfect.

I was around 17 years old at the time, walking home down 153 street between Courtlandt Avenue and Morris Ave. with chinese takeout food. It was around 9:00pm and the sky was pretty clear. 

From the corner of my right eye up on the sky I spotted some lights. At first because the lights were so bright, I thought it was some kind of fireworks, but the lights never disolved. Instead the object moved silently from north to south. My building where I lived is 14 stories tall, and the object seemed it was about triple the height of the building. 

The large object had about 9 lights, 5 in the front almost in a octigon shape and the about 4 lights tailing it. All the lights moved as if the object was one. I got the impression it was one object. I was amazed, something that large, that close didn't make any noise what so ever.

I have seen blimps in the past, and you could hear them. This was no blimp. Also, a few months later, I saw on TV a home video that someone took showing the same craft I witnessed.

While driving northwest on Highway 38, 2 miles southeast of Sheridan, Indiana, at exactly 8:30PM est, my girlfriend and I noticed a streaking white light shooting almost straight down. It was visible only briefly and left no trail as would a meteor. Within a few seconds, a bright white light appeared to the right and above where we saw the first light. Momentarily, another white light appeared to the right of the first one, some distance from it. Sequentially, a third light appeared equidistant from the second light, to the right, and then a fourth. As the fourth light came on, the first light went out. A fifth light came on and then the second light went out. The distance between the lights and the angle the array created would suggest a chevron shape. We stopped the car, got out to observe, but by then they had all vanished. We could not determine the altitude of the object[s] and Im guessing it to be 2-3000 ft due to the partly cloudy skies.

Flashing light from silent hovering triangle over Bankson Lake causes wittnesses eyes to burn and water for days after sighting.

I was not there that weekend to see the object reported but from what I have been able to gather this is an excellent case.. Why? becuase it happened in 1986 and I dont think the flying triangle was seen or reported at that time.. That didnt happen until 1989 over Belguim.. Similiar cases after 1989 have detailed wavy air or something seen coming out of the object. In other words, this is one of the first. Michigans chapter of Mufon did investigate but know one claimed to have seen the object except for these two people.. I know for a fact that more people did see this object becuase they are the ones I heard it from.. One described to me a diamond shaped object that reminds me of the Cash Landrum case of the early 80's. In the Cash Landrum case it was reported that the victoms had burning and watery eyes caused by exteem levels of Untra Violet light.. Makes me wonder if the two people mentioned in the article below were exposed to the same kind of UV lighting..

Here is the story of the Bankson Lake Triangle From the Kalamazoo Gazzete and featured in the newsletter page of banksonlake.org Here are some highlights from the article that was put into the Kalamazoo Gizzette on September 1986 Not Everyone will believe John Long and fishing buddy Richard Jandura, story about the huge UFO they saw over Bankson Lake near Lawton on the evening of Aug. 1st 1986 Both witnesses eyes burned for days after watching the silent triangular object fly over head.

""It is a very credible report, Very credible,"" said Shirley Coyne of Flushing, director of MUFON's Michigan chapter.

What the two fisherman claimed to have seen around 10:30 that clear night was a giant spacecraft about the size of Wings Stadium Long said . The object had a bright light in front and three red lights blinking on each side.

The craft moved slowly from the southeast toward the northwest about 200 to 300 ft over the lake, the white light in front suddenly flashed brilliantly and went out.

There were several other fisherman on the lake, apparently none of them saw the UFO because it moved with absolute silence. The flash of light ws beamed toward the front of the craft, so it did not reflect off the water.

Jandura heard a young boy on the shore yelling ""What is it?"" What is it?"" as the UFO traveled slowly across the lake for about 15 minutes.

To the person who was yelling what is it? please feel free to contact me with what you saw, if you are out there.

As the craft moved off in the direction of South Haven the two fisherman saw a wavy pattern in the air behind it, as though somekind of exhaust.

The Kalamazoo county airport was contacted and nothing unusual was reported on radar.

It should be noted that 30 minutes prior to this event a similiar objects was seen over Jamestown Ohio. Aproximately for 5 minutes. Earlier that day over Texas yet another stranged shaped object was spotted and reported.

As I collect more information on this case including witness testimony I will update you through this submition form.

It flickered like a fireplace or lantern would. It was almost as if a plane had a very large lantern lit on or in it, but it looked nothing like a typical light you would see on a plane. There were no other lights around it. I have seen meteoritesÂ before and it did not look anything like aÂ meteorite.

The light continued in an east-southeast direction for about 30-45 more seconds before it became more distant and disappeared; then the sky was completely dark in the place itÂ one was.

I captured it on my car's dash cam and also on my phone camera. In the dash cam, it is the light that approaches the upper left of the frame.

Some were in formations other were not. There would be bursts of speed then very slow as if trying to pass for stars should anyone look up. I had to ask others there if they were seeing what i was seeing and like me the first explanation was that they were planes, but the altitude was too high and their light to bright for anything conventional and the speed to great, not to mention the size they must have been to cast such a light at that altitude. 

After they passed there was a brief period where the sky was just black then the stars! were all there in their normal locations I stood there in disbelief while other said to call the police or someone. Some of the women there even started to cry saying it was armegedon. I just could not believe what I saw and so many and not one of our jets was in the sky? ""I live near a flight path"".

The second one was following a different path, and like the first vanished from sight behind the mountain to our north. There was no sound generated from these two objects. There was only one aircraft in the vicinity with blinking red and white lights. This aircraft was travelling from the east to the west.

I want to add that I do NOT believe in these things, however, I thought I should report it. 

We see many aircraft and I work on an airport and see many different aircraft. In my years, I have never seen anything like these two objects.

Adding these lights were constant and not flashing. Towards the end of the visual on both objects, the light seemed to fade, then get bright again, and then fade away.

They also moved right to left. After watching this for a few minutes I said to myself, okay, I am not seeing this.

Two friends and I were at Lake Worth late at night near Fort Worth, TX sometime back in the late '70s or early '80s. I happend to see a ""star"" move. It looked like any other star. It wasn't the brightes and it wasn't the dimmest. It moved in a circular pattern; that is it quickly (about 1/2 second) made one circle with a diameter of about 3/4"" (using my fingers at arms length to measure this and the following apparent distances), and then remained motionless for several minutes. I didn't say anything because I felt that if it didn't move again my friends might pass it off as an eye movement.

It finally moved again, this time it moved in a straight line about 4 apparent inches accross the sky. There was no appearance of accelleration or decelleration; just a quick move. It then sat motionless again for a few minutes. It made another circle, and one of my friend said, ""Did anybody see thst?"" I said that I've been watching it.

It behaved this way for quite some time, making circles and straight lines, and remaining motionless for minutes between moves. The circles all seemed to be the same size, but the length of the lines varied from about 4"" to about 18"". It always looked like a star: no flashing or colored lights, and it always held the same brightness. The last time we saw it is when it disappeared into the sky (or over the horizon) with a long, straight-line dash. There it was, and then darted off, out of sight in about a second or less.

What I find interesting about this is WHERE it occurred. It was directly over what at that time was Carswell AFB. From where we were sitting, if there was any ground activity on base, we could have seen it. We saw no military activity. Not on the ground, not in the air.

This is a place to report; not to speculate, but I can't help myself :) I'm now under the impression that thing was being operated by our Air Force.

This picture was taken in July 2006 on a trip to Crete in Europe. I didnt notice this blurry ""thing"" on the picture only when i started looking pictures in fullsize on computer in January 2007. There is the possibility that this undentified flying object might be dust on the lens or some ""mistake"" the camera made, altough it is not seen on the next picture made few minutes later. I am also 100 % sure that the dot on the picture cant be plane nor a fight plane, altough there were fighter planes flying by at the same day, but the noise they made cant be unnoticed. Pictures was taken in the mountains, therefore it is also impossible for that thing to be a plane. I didnt see the thing myself, but noticed it half a year later.

At around 7:30 p.m. Thursday, my girlfriend and I were driving back home to St. Charles headed from the western portion of St. Louis County. As I was driving up the entrance ramp to the highway, we both noticed four very noticeable, but strangely 'dull' circular lights moving in the sky, in a perfectly straight formation. They stayed horizontal for a minute before then moving in every which direction. At one point, around the time my girlfriend began recording the lights, the light at the 'top' of the formation suddenly 'faded' out and then re-appeared at the 'bottom' of the formation within maybe two or three seconds. Before I process what just happpened, the same light faded out again and, once more, appeared at the top of the formation.

From there, the lights seemed to move around more freely than before. Once I got off the highway, I kept driving instead of heading home. It was then that the lights moved into a triangluar formation for maybe 10-15 seconds before going back to the four-light formation. That was the last we saw of them for the night due to buildings blocking that portion of the night sky.

I should note the distance between each of the lights could not have been more than a few hundred feet. While this happened, several passenger planes could be seen flying in the distance. The lights and the way they carried themselves were completely and totally different from the four lights we were looking at. There was no constant blinking in the formation, just repeated glowing. Again, the lights were all white, but it was 'dull.' I really don't know how else to describe it. It seemed to have a very slight tint to it.

On Monday morning 08/12/02, 7:30 am, I notice a triangualar object hovering between apple trees on a hill that overlooks my backyard. The object then rose from the the ground level to over 80-90 yards up over the tree line. It did this in less that a second.

I then woke my son and pointed the object out. While he viewed this object I ran downstairs to get my digital olympus camera and then ran out into the middle of my back yard. The object had moved 200 yards east and at that time i manages to snap 6 pictures of an object that I cannot explain. There was no wind, there was no sound and it moved faster than any objest that I have seen. The shape was trinagualar and seemed to spin like a top. After exmining the pictures at 800X, we noticed a white field arounf the object that looked very interesting.

Walked outside to ensure our gate was locked, as our dogs wanted to go outside. When checking the gate, I noticed an extremely bright light on the other side of the mountain. Object was incredible bright, moving very slowly right to left. I observed the object for a few minutes, then rushed inside to get my phone so I could get a picture. Object was moving towards a tall tree in a straight line, then as the object passed behind the tree, started descending below the mountain, out of view. I took a couple of photos, but only the first pic managed to capture the object. When I looked at the first photo, I could see a dark shape above the bright light. Note: When viewing the bright object, I did not notice any dark shape in the sky. Visibility was excellent, so I don't know why the camera picked up this dark shape, when I didn't see this with my eye. When I looked at my second picture, the bright object had moved out of view and the dark shape had disappeared. My first guess was that the dark shape was a reflection of the object, but if it was a reflection, then the reflection should have been visible in my second photo. The bright white object was moving too slow to be a plane or a meteor. Could not have been a weather balloon, as we had quite a strong breeze, which would have affected a balloon's path, and was not a helicopter as the shape was quite clearly defined and there was no sound.

I went outside about 7 PM to see how cold it was, and while I was outdoor I remembered that a meteor shower was reported on the weather, so decided to let my eyes get accustomed to the dark in hopes to see some meteors. Saw a bright moving light, star like, and thought, oh a satellite, as it was at that altitude I normally see a satellite, and I will watch that while I was there. I am very familiar with satellites, have seen and tracked many over the years, and thought gee this one is much brighter than normal of those I usually have seen. Object was moving from North to South on a slight angle. It got about ENE, just above a pine tree, I used as a reference point, with no tree limbs obstructing my view, and the object stopped dead, hovered for a minute or so, then changed direction 180 degrees to the North. It went a short distance, say about an two inches or so in the sky, a decent distance that I could gauge, and stopped again, reversed again 180 degrees, went about half the distance back the same path to the South, and stopped again. It then did a small circle, say about a 1/2 in in diameter, kind of wiggling as it went in the circle. It then continued on a path to the South and stopped. All the while I was watching I could not believe what I was witnessing, and wished I had my phone. Once it stopped, I watched a minute or so, and since it was still, I ran inside to get my phone, my wife asked what was the problem, as I was almost running told her I am watching a UFO and wanted to get my camera. I had took notice of the position, using he pine tree as a maker, it was about 5 degrees above the tree, in a very clear sky. When I got back outside, no more than a minute, it was still in the same location, but perfectly still. It never moved again, while I was watching for the next 5 minutes. Wife was probably rolling her eyes, as I pointed it out to her, but it never moved again. After 5 minutes, and since it was about 14 degrees , I went back inside. While I was outside with the camera, I tried to record the object, in the event it moved again, but I was unable see anything on the video.

When I was a child, my friends and I were playing war around the block until dusk. Everyone left to go home except my friend from next door and myself. We were sitting on the sidewalk in between our homes talking when we both saw movement above our heads and looked up. The triangular shaped object, about 18-20' long seemed to be following the direction of the road (North) then it physically turned (not banked) left. I say it turned because at the speed it was traveling (about 60-70 MPH), it any plane would have needed to bank. It flew right above the tree tops (approx. 40-50 feet), made no sound (but a slight whoosh), had no lights, was completely black, didn't shake the trees, and had no flame from behind (like the flame from a jet). We sat there looking in the sky for about another hour hoping it would come back, completely dumbfounded. We thought it was strange that we would see such a thing in our neighborhood (very busy suburb of Philadelphia) and we were only 12 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport. I would have thought that the airport would have seen it on radar. I can't be sure of the date, but I know it was summer and we were 13, or 14 (either 1983 or 1984). The closest movie type space craft I could relateit to was a star fighter from Battlestar Galactica. It seemed to be a triangular shaped pyramid.

First, I am an avid sky-watcher and have been deeply interested, and have studied UFO sightings for a long time. I have seen, and can identify planes at night.. and do NOT mis-identify a plane for a UFO. For example, I know that planes on approach (moving directly towards the observer) can appear very bright and seem to hover. Other times you may not see the red & green lights, but only a red light due to the distance, or the angle of the plane. I know helicopter lights, have seen countless satellites, as well as meteors. I know MANY constellations, and know what planets are observable in the night sky at all times. What I am about to explain is none of these.

Also.. this is my first post to MUFON, and the first time in all my years where I have seen something and cannot explain. I can't say this is extra-terrestrial.. only very different from what I have ever seen. This is not a fantastic sighting.. merely very odd.

At approximately 9pm on 8/4 I observed a flash of white light in the sky out of my bathroom window. It was brief, and did not reoccur for several seconds after. I watched the section of sky for about 10 seconds and the light appeared again, then vanished. This time I believe the light was white and some red. I quickly went outside to the back yard as I knew this was not a normal object. It took about 10 seconds to get to the back. Once outside I saw the flash again and told my wife to come out and see. From this point on both my wife and I observed this object together.

Upon first seeing the object it was at approximately 335 degrees (NW) in the sky, and within the vicinity of the constellation Ursa Minor. It traveled in what I believe was a straight line, and the last I observed it was at about 35 degrees (NE) of me.. just to the east of the constellation Cassiopeia. There were no clouds in the night sky and it was very clear.

The lights were not like a satellite, plane, or helicopter:
The object would either emit a single bright flash (like a strobe), or phase in and out. Each time there was approximately a 10-15 second delay between flashes. At times when it would flash it was very dim and hardly observable, but at others (usually when it would flash like a strobe) it would be as bright as the planet Jupiter (about a -2.5 magnitude). Each time it emitted light it was a bit further along on its path towards the east. 

Object speed:
The speed of the object did not match that of a plane, or satellite. It took approximately 12-15 minutes to travel about 60 degrees (335 to 35) across the night sky. In my experience if this were a satellite it would have taken half the time or less to travel this distance... and most certainly if it were a plane it would have traveled that distance much quicker.

In summary - the speed did not match any object I have formerly observed, and the flashing was also very odd. Other than that the sighting was quite benign. Odd though.

I have attached a video of the object. You can only see it a couple of times when it flashed.. it was difficult for me to determine if this object was within the field of view of the camera since it was not a constant light. You can see it flash at :20, :40 and 2:40.",US,

Then all of a sudden the two lights seemed to split into five or six objects, and then coming at us with incredible speed, they then stopped just above us, now I was scared. The lights were emitting a sort of strange glowing feel above us, then two of the craft flew over some nearby hills going out of sight and then a large beam of light was seen coming up from over the hills. The rest of the crafts still hovered over head performing amazing maneuvers seeming as if to defy gravity with there smooth twists and turns- and then they shot up and disappeared.

Last summer in the middle of July, my roommate (J.), the girl next door (C.), and I were sitting on our roof. J. and C. were drinking beer, but still not nearly drunk. I was completely sober when this occured because I hadn't acquired a taste for beer at the time. I'm more of a wine enthusiast, but I didn't have any alcohol in me at the time.

We were stargazing, and there was an unusual number of shooting stars because of one of the meteor cycles. If I remembered the date, I could be more specific. Unfortunately, I don't recall the exact date or time of this occurance and I didn't have a camera handy because I don't just sit there with a camera expecting odd things to happen. Nor do I expect that any camera I've ever had before my newest one could take a clear picture of what I'm about to describe.

Anyhow, me and J. were laying on our backs looking up at the sky while C. was laying on her chest facing the other direction. Suddenly, an array of about 6 lights flew overhead. Excitedly, both J. and I sat up.

""Did you just see what I saw?"" I asked.

""I'm glad you asked. I thought it might've been the beer,"" said J.

""No. It definitely wasn't,"" I said.

""What did you guys see?"" C. asked.

J. and I just looked at eachother and we both said, ""A UFO."" ""Or maybe more than one,"" I thought aloud.

J. agreed.

Anyhow, C. was ticked off because she believes in UFOs and aliens and the like but J. and I are more skeptical but open-minded. Still, I can't deny that I saw something strange that night. It couldn't have been a usual airplane or helicopter because the lights were just wrong. They weren't blinking, and they were in sort of a V formation, but offset like a flock of birds and in the same sort of flight path (diagram below), but making no noise.

*---*---* | * | * | * I know there's a Gov't nuclear site called the INL (previously INEEL) nearby, so perhaps it could've been something in connection with that, especially since whatever this UFO was seemed to be heading that general direction. I've been on the INL site before, but it was in high school for a field trip and there were limits on where we were allowed to go because a lot of top secret research goes on there. I know they've had connections with the air force before though, because of stories from a previous employer. I understand that seeing a unfamiliar aircraft can make a person uneasy as make us start thinking about aliens and all sorts of things because the members of his community had the same reaction when they saw the first airplanes flying overhead and then their first helicopter.

Anyhow, back to my story.... As these UFOs came in, they slowed down and nearly came to a stop (though not directly over us, and I have the feeling whatever they were, they were entirely unbothered by our presence). They were heading s/sw, but shortly after passing over us and slowing, they abruptly changed course about w/sw. To me it seems they were either headed for the INL or attempting to just barely avoid it, or waiting for directions to a landing site. Whatever the case is, they made some sort of course correction, so I highly doubt it was just a group of shooting stars. In fact, that possibility is entirely implausible in my opinion.

I think it's important to also state that there is an airport just minutes from my apartment, nearly due north, but this UFO appearance was heading the wrong direction to have either taken off from the airport or to have been heading for it. It was flying low enough that we should have heard noise and I could almost make out the shape of an object, but not quite, and any shape I might have seen might have been an optical illusion from the lights. My best guess is that if this was a single object though, it was either triangular or even in cube shape, though a triangular object seems more aerodynamic and thus more logical to me. It seems to me this was more than one object though and that they were ""connected"" but not by any physical means, if that makes any sense. Either by some magnetic field or a programmed flight path.

It ejected a much smaller ball of light that flew off to the right. The main light slowly descended in hight, then followed the same path.

I was walking my dog across the moors, opposite a reservoir called Blackstone Edge, located on Rochdale Road A58. Walking towards the old Roman road, there's a hill side that blocks the view of the M62 Motorway. With a big valley bellow it and another reservoir at the bottom, called Green Withens Reservoir. 

Above that hill line I saw a very bright ball of light that remained stationary for 3 or 4 minutes, with a subtle wobble which made it look odd. At first I presumed it was a plane with it's headlights on, though it grabbed my attention because it didn't seem to be moving, and there were no blinking wing lights or any sound considering how low it seemed to be.It was also noticeably brighter than a plane. 
I stopped and watched it, then it ejected a very small ball of light which then travelled off to the right about 25 degrees above the hill line, in a straight line, very smoothly at a steady pace.
I watched this small ball of light fly straight until it disappeared bellow the curve of the hill. I stood and waved my arms at it to say hello, as it didn't seem that far away and only just over the other side of the hill. I stood waving for about 30 or 40 seconds, at that point the main brighter ball of light started to slowly descend down, it seemed to stop just at the crest of the hill, almost out of sight. I could only see half of the ball of light peaking above the hill, it stopped descending and flew to the right at a steady speed following the same path as the smaller ball it ejected. I had to jump up in the air to watch it as it went, but I clearly saw it stop descending and immediately started flying to the right. The direction would be moving towards Littleborough.. I watched it until it disappeared bellow the rising hill line. 

I ran around to a better vantage point which took a couple of minutes to reach, but I could no longer see either objects. I could see a number of planes in the area, at least 10 or so planes were flying in different directions over a period of 10 minutes I was stood looking for it, they were at much higher altitude. These were all very easily identifiable as planes, and could easily see blinking wing lights and flashing, even planes that had their headlights on you could easily see they were planes. This object was much brighter, much lower and remained still only with a slight wobble. Then descended, and changed direction with a steady non changing bright light. With no blinking coloured lights or wings. It was completely silent. I am sure it was not a plane, or a helicopter. I would hear it if it was a helicopter, or you would notice a change in it's light and shape as it descended and turned. It was hard to judge distance as to how far away the object was, but it seemed to be half way between the M62 motorway and the Hill, flying over the main stretch of open moor lands parallel to the motorway at a relatively low altitude. 

When walking back, shortly after seeing the object a very thick fog rolled in and removed almost all visibility of the surrounding area. This was just as the sun was going down also, I didn't have my phone with me, otherwise I would have taken a photograph or filmed it. I can't explain what it was.",GB,

Clear skies for Thursday night January 12, 2012 in Saratoga, CA. I was outside on the phone talking to a friend who lived approximately 25 miles north in San Mateo and was inside their house. Suddenly, I saw a flash of light across the sky almost instantaneous coming from a Western direction across the sky towards the East. The light was so fast that while I saw it I thought it was lightning but while the light flashed I reminded myself that we had unseasonably hot and clear weather with no rain for a month. Then once the light flash ended, all the lights flickered, street lights, neighbors house lights and inside lights and even our own house. I was talking on the phone while I witnessed this and said I saw a light flash across the sky and the lights just flickered off. My friend on the phone said that while I said this, their house lights flickered off and then on again. I would have thought this was nothing but a power spike, except that I saw the light a! cross the sky flashed in a flick of an eye. There was no object, just a flash of light across the entire sky as thought it was coming from the West (Pacific Ocean or San Francisco) area. The entire moment from the light across the sky to then the electrical energy bleep lasted 3-4 seconds. If you blinked, you would have missed the light across the sky. The electrical outage came after the light, and was a longer bleep. This happened again approximately 30-45 seconds later. However, this time the flash of light was barely noticeable and the power flicker only hit the street lights. I do not live near any electrical power center or any large electrical wires. What was odd is that 25 miles north my friend experienced the same thing, but did not see the light flash because they were indoors. There were no forms of evidence such as pictures, except that my friend witnessed the electrical outage.

While driving east on 8 Mile Road near Woodward Avenue at approximately 8:00 p.m. on March 7, 2012, my cousin and I saw a bright glowing object in the southern west part of the sky. At first we thought it was a plane, but it glowed too much to be a plane. But it couldn1t be a star either because it was too low and too bright. 

We turned left as soon as we could and began traveling south to get a better view. I wanted to get a clearing so I could tape it with my flip video. Once we had a clear view, I stopped the car and began to film it. Another glowing object, blinking on and off appeared along side it. 

My cousin was kind of freaking out, but I was excited. So I took a quick video of Venus and Jupiter in the other part of the sky to show that is not what we saw. As bright as Venus and Jupiter were that night, they did not glow nearly as bright as these glowing lights.

I found this observation most peculiar - my thoughts were, what the hell is that? I came to the conclusion it could not be a drone copter as it was too high and must have travelled a fair number of miles during my observation...not possible for a remote control drone copter as range of radio control would be an issue... 

I also noticed no sound, although I could clearly hear the aircraft observed during this period, the pilots of which I would suggest must have also observed this light their aircraft was flying west/south west to east/north east...

The first sighting was approximately two months prior to the sighting I am posting about now from this last Wednesday (11-4-15) at exactly 2:50 a.m. I am a Private Investigator my late twenties and work crazy long hours so needless to say I was asleep on the couch when my Fiance woke me up in a frightened state saying that she just observed something unexplainable in the sky upon walking outside to have a smoke. I immediately walked outside and much to my surprise there it was. Distance, size and altitude were obviously impossible to determine due to it being far up in the sky. However, I can say with certainty that it was large and was at a far distance from my position in the field behind my residence. This object was absolutely silent and the only observable features about it was that it was a bright glowing white orb (I refer to it as an Orb because it appeared this way from the constant bright light. I dont know if it was a craft or what) with what a! ppeared to be flashing lights of blue red green and yellow (however this was just observation by the naked eye and could have been a larger or a smaller spectrum of colors). It is hard to say if the changing flashs of different colors was from a spinning movement around the center of it was flashing from the center like a strobe. 

I want to point out that while this specific experience I am speaking about is from me and my Fiances first experience from two months prior, both experiences had the exact same type movements that I am about to describe. The main difference is that the first sighting was at approximately 2:50 a.m. and the most recent sighting was at 10:15 p.m. and BOTH SIGHTINGS HAPPENED IN THE SAME LOCATION IN THE SKY. It helped me out that I had the same two tall trees in my field to use as landmarks while looking up in the sky and allowed us to be able to tell that the objects maneuvers were actually being done and that it was just a trick to our eyes. The objects maneuvers are what really took us by surprise in th! at it changed in speed at random while going from a hovering position to suddenly darting to the left or right. Also it made circular flying motions as well as moving from a stationary hover to the left then suddenly making nearly a 90 turn and going vertical. All of these types of maneuvers were observed many times and at multiple patterns (Such as darting to the right then shooting straight up all while never changing speed, or while flying in one direction suddenly maneuvering into making an almost perfect circle in the sky) I do not feel that this was a standard aircraft of any kind as it showed no lighting like any citizen passenger or military aircraft I have ever observed. It also did not appear to be moving farther away from our position or so much closer either as its size should have decreased or increased as it flew away or flew closer to us. All of the patterns and sudden changes in speed were observed in a relatively local area in the sky for a very long period of time. At the end of the sighting on the first night, we observed the orb as it ended up flying down out of the local area where it had seemed to hang around and appeared at this point to start flying away from us towards the horizon. However while it was still easily observable in the atmosphere, it seemed to us as if it almost blinked out of existence. The most recent sighting we never witnessed when or how it departed due to both of us having to call it a night and go to bed due to having to be up early for work the next morning. While observing this anomaly on both nights, I first grabbed the first thing with a camera which was my Galaxy S5 with a 16 mp high definition camera in it. While I know that this isnt super great camera wise, I thought just maybe since this orb is illuminated so well it would pick it up. However, I was wrong. So I can to one of my gear bags I have for my job and just grabbed the first handheld camcorder I could find and it was my Samsung camcorder ! which isnt anything fancy just a 32x zoom but usually has don! e me alr ight even in most low light scenarios. And again seeing how illuminated this object was I thought surely it would pick it up at least somewhat. But no. I am just hoping that someone else could have observed this event near me. I do want to put out that being the I live in the very northwest part of AL, this object easily in my opinion was hovering and doing these crazy maneuvers over the state of TN or MS. I know MS has an Air Force Base however the only one that comes to mind right off is a bit south of where this orb would have been flying over. So anyone who can help me out here explaining this please dont hesitate to contact me.

I was coming home from work and had just pulled into my driveway. I exited the vehicle and glanced over the top of my house to the north...I always do this when I come home from work. I do not know why. I live in a pretty dense neighborhood (my lot is .18 of an acre), but being a weeknight it was quiet..no dogs barking, no people out so pretty typical.

I live in the flight path of two airports, one that houses mostly business jets as well as recreational aircraft; the other regional jets to international flyers. I also am subject to the hospital emergency helicopter, aka LifeStar, from time to time and also grew up in the flight path of a military base and get buzzed by the Met Life blimp once a year due to a PGA Golf Tournament that is run a few towns over, so I am pretty familiar with what I should and should NOT be hearing above my head.

Like I said, I exited the vehicle and glanced above my house to the north. My routine. I was stopped short because I heard something that didn't sound right. It was a low steady frequency with absolutely ZERO movement to it. It did not sound mechanical. I focused my eyes to where it was coming from. Then up and above my house and over the tops of the trees this massive vessel/craft/ship appeared, strong and steady.

It was a long, blunt triangle shape. Think of a triangle with the tip cut off. On each of the 4 points there was a steady bright white light I took to be the indicator lights. Between the back 2 white indicator lights, there was a big bright red light that blinked, not fast..slow and steady. On the blunt tip between those 2 indicator lights there was what seemed like a wall of lights that only shone straight ahead...like headlights per say. This ship was either very low or very big. 

As it passed overhead heading in a southerly direction, I just stood there, quite literally frozen to the spot, mesmerized by what I was seeing. I had my iPhone in my hand but I didn't want to take my eyes off it even for a second so I could be present and remember what I saw so I could keep every detail in my head. As it passed,it was all I saw, all I heard and nothing else mattered. I was not scared.. I was more, interested and curious.

On this particular day, I awoke sometime between five and six in the morning, and as was so often the case, I simply decided to lie there until it was time for our house parent to awaken us at 6:30. 

All of a sudden I heard from across the room what I can only describe as a sort of trumpet fanfare. It came from high on the wall. Im guessing there was only a second between the fanfare and the startling thing that happened next. I heard my dear, sweet friend suddenly emerge from the exact place where the music came from. It sounded to me as though he simply came through the wall, and he was sobbing as he was turned over in mid-air and then dropped on his bed. He cried for a few more seconds before he went to sleep. 

I can assure you I did not go back to sleep. I can also say that the boy who slept in the bed next to mine had also been wide awake, and he heard the sound of a brass fanfare too. I know he did, because I overheard him later that day humming under his breath the exact notes that had come from high on the wall. 

I never did ask my dear, sweet friend what happened to him. After all we were only seven years old at the time. 

The following school year I heard that he had moved to another state, so I never got the chance to ask him about this terrifying experience. Who in the world (or from another world) would have taken my friend out of his bed in the middle of the night, and where did they take him. Whatever they did to him made him sob, and whoever brought him back just dropped him on his stomach on the bed. 

I would gladly answer any further questions you might have about this most unsettling experience from early 1977.

((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))

Thanks so much, Peter, for getting back in touch with me as quickly as you did. 

I have been carrying around this story inside my head for forty years, all the while wondering who would believe such a thing. The person who overheard the sound of the brass fanfare and who rehearsed it perfectly later that day is name ((name deleted)). He presently lives in Atlanta. In a phone conversation seven years ago, I asked him if he any recollection of the incident. Alas, he had no memory of the experience. 

The primary person in the story is named ((name #2 deleted)), and I wouldn't even begin to know how to contact him. It seems as though his father was in one of the branches of the U.S. military, and was connected in some way to the State of Alaska. I did not report the incident to anyone at the Academy For The Blind, and as far as I know, ((name #1 deleted)) didn't report it either. 

In all your years of gathering and sorting through U.F.O. stories, have you ever heard anything like what happened to ((name #2 deleted)) in March of 1977? 

Most curious of all in some respects was the brass fanfare ((name #1 deleted)) and I heard just before ((name #2 deleted)) materialized in mid-air. What occurs to me now even as I type this is the possible link between ((name #2 deleted)) having been abducted, and his father's serving in the military. 

Blessings to you,

Rev. ((name deleted))

Hey, Peter, 

In whatever way my story might be helpful to the U.F.O. community, my heart would be gladdened by it. Of course, let me know if there is anything else I might contribute to the burgeoning literature on abductions. 

One question for you, (and it's probably one you get all the time), will I ever know what happened to ((name deleted--abductee)) that morning? What was it I heard back in 1977?

I was driving my semi eastward on I10 in nevada, just after crossing the NV border.

My co-drivier was asleep in the back. I spotted 5 to 8 bright lights in the sky south of us, in a crooded line from about 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, they were orange in colour and stationary. I figured they were flares until one moved upward. After about 10 minutes of observation, I pulled my truck over on an offramp and parked.

At the place I pulled over, there was noone else, it was a small construction site with a large pile of dirt. I got my camera, a 35 MM auto everything deal, and exited the truck, watching the objects, I climbed to the top of the pile and proceeded to take pictures. they moved a little, blinking on and off, and moving 5 to 10 degrees toward or away (up and down) from each other.

I ran out of film, after taking a full roll (I reloaded once) of 24 exposures and 6 exposures on the other roll, watched for 30 to 45 minutes, then, pursuant to my schedul, I took off. I could see them almost all the way to AZ.

Unfortunately, The film did not turn out, as Walmart's photo dept is incompetent, however, I still have the negatives, as well as a small notebook with specific date and times from my first noting them, until I lost them in light pollution, but they are somewhere in the chaos I have in my house since I moved.

The weather that night was extremely clear, no clouds.

I was wide awake, having just awaken in California, and started driving 3 hours before.

1) The strange things were that, even though I pulled over on a rough road, my co-  driver did not awaken, as any driver will tell you they will when the truck stops 2) I remember clearly the stop was 20 to 30 minutes, yet, I lost very little time in the log book, I even had time to get back in the truck to recover my spare roll of film! The objects were clearly round, but not bright like a star or a light would be, more like a glow in the dark decal would be, except not green, but a orange colour. if they were 25 feet wide, I would put them at 1600 to 1800 meters away.

I will give a more full report when I find my notebook, and possibly rescan the negatives, when I get my scanner installed. Maybe Walmart just hosed up the prints. I can only hope.

I was 5 years old. My mom had just put me to bed for the night. I was laying in my bed, facing the wall when I had felt a sensation of being watched. I rolled over onto my back to see a ""being"" standing at the foot of my bed just watching me. It was standing there unmoving. It was very tall, about 7 feet. When I saw it, I didn't feel fear. I laid there staring back at it and studying it. To me it was massive but emanated no reason for me to fear it. It felt like forever that we were watching each other. Then I heard a ""voice"" say ""roll onto your side and sleep"". I followed the orders the voice had said to me. I laid that way for only about 1 minute. I then looked over to where I had seen the creature. It was gone. I got out of my bed to see where it had gone. All my windows were closed and locked. I walked out into the living room where my parents were watching TV. They asked me what I was doing up, I had stated I was thirsty. While my mom walked me back to my room and gave me a drink, I was looking for this creature and found nothing. For many years after this sighting I thought it was the Boogeyman. Until I was 15 years old and was watching a show about alien encounters and it was showing different aliens that had been seen throughout the world. On this program, I saw, for the first time since my encounter, this alien being that I had seen that night. I was in complete shock and excited that I had finally discovered what I had seen that night when I was 5 years old.

Traveling home from a friends house this evening at 11:00 P.M. central time in Columbia MO, turning onto Broadway Blvd., my sister and I witnessed 2 very bright lights in the sky toward the west side of the Blvd. At first I thought it may be a bright pair of stars in the sky, but as we approached, and it approached us, I seriously began to grow concerned. The object seemed to be traveling along the street, toward us, but moving very slowly and only flying about 200-300 ft off the ground above the street. Originally 2 lights were in view, but as we got closer, I noticed that there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft, in a triangle formation. At this point I was literally yelling at my sister to confirm the object herself, and she seemed very concerned about it as well. The object then passed directly over our vehicle while we were stopped at a light. I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object, and to see if there were any sounds coming from the craft... there were none, which seemed very disturbing to me. I asked my sister if she heard anything, such as helicopter rotors or an aircraft engine, and she said she did not. As I looked straight up at the craft, I very clearly saw that it was triangular in shape, with a circular light at each tip, and an illuminated white line connecting each light. There was also a square panel at the bottom of the craft that was glowing red, and a smaller yellow light next to that that was pulsing. I have never seen anything like this before. The craft moved so slowly that it is impossible to have stayed airborne if it were a plane, and absolutely no sound was heard coming from the craft at close proximity to indicate that it was some sort of helicopter. The object then continued east down the Blvd. until it was out of sight. This object must surely have been seen by many observers, and after seeing it, cars around us were driving erratically, passing each other on city streets illegally and driving very fast.

About 10pm Sunday evening September 8th my husband walked outside for some fresh air, looked up into the sky and I heard him say ""Am I seeing things?""

I opened curtains to blow smoke out of window of bedroom into enclosed screened in porch. As I opened window a craft approx 50 feet away and 130 feet above ground level slowly descended from right to left,or south to North, at approx 100 feet above ground or 20 feet above tree tops (as I was located on 8th floor and above small forest area directly behind Building# 21 with tree tops approx 80 feet tall but below my 8th floor level. The craft was completely silent and displayed a variety of...very fast, Random in patterns of illumination of external surface areas that covered all exterior surfaces of the... semi Rectangular object or craft . with extremely bright (Red,Blue and White) lights... Flickering with intensity and brilliance at timed bursting and dimming Randomized fashion. As the craft leveled off it hovered while slightly dipping to its left or towards my direction, which
revealed the source of flickering lights to be emanating from small rectangular boxes that made up all exterior surface area of entire craft. These Emergency ""type"" lights within rectangular reflective surface area boxes were apparent all over the craft. As the craft slowly moved from left to right the lights persisted but less intense and slower in Random illumination. The lights were also on the rear portion or back area of the craft as it moved away from my position at about 3 mph. I ran to get my phone to record the craftand climbed out the bedroom window to get a close up video of this event as i stayed the light show continued as it traveled from south to northeast running parallel to interstate 192 towards interstate 4 bit the phone kept focusing on the screens that enclosed the entire porch to which I climbed from the bedroom window to the porch. The moon was full and the phone camera did briefly focus on that but as I tried to focus on the craft which had now clearly passef the 3rd building farthest away from my position the craft lifted and banked to the left or west hovering for only a second or 2 and began a deliberate decline in altitude towards the ground and disappeared behind the first building out of sight. I immediately grabbed all I needed to leave the building such as my Resort supplied Enterance key card and left my room to get on the elevator to get to bottom floor and leaving my building to view the craft landing. As I exited my building I noticed two Fire trucks in front of the last building of the 3 buildings that made up our resort area. My heart sank thinking perhaps rhis craft had something to do with the Fire trucks as they also had Red flickering Emergency lights although less brilliant in intensity and clearly contained with in the Light fixtures on top of the roofs of the vehicles. I walked across the parking lot and tried several times to ask people if they saw the craft behind the building but nobody saw it. As I flagged down a Taxi that came towards my direction but had been on Interstate 192 heading south turning left towards me on Arabian Nights Boulevard..je also said he did not see it. I returned to the front of the buildings as the Fire trucks left with Emergency lights turned off and walked to the security guards that gathered where the Fire Trucks were located. I asked several security guards if they saw what I did they said no. I then realized that it would have been impossible for them as the building was at least 13 stories high and would have obstructed their view. I described what I saw and asked where the nearest hospital was located and if there were any silent crafts displaying all the lights I saw that responded to Emergencies accompanying the Fire trucks that had just left. They said No and laughed. I then started to question myself as to what I just experienced and realized that the completely Silent craft I watched just outside my 8th floor window was not an Emergency vehicle associated with the event in front of the buildings but Mimicking the lights in a explosive display of lights of same colors as it slowly decended in front of my window in back of the buildings 80 feet from the ground but 20 feet or so...above my floor above the tree tops as it dipped and hovered slightly and continued traveling towards Interstate 4 but remained at a constant altitude before lifting slightly banking to the left and descended on an angle and out of my view to land. I eas absolutely shocked as to what i witnessed and I am positive the Surveillance tapes at the Resort and surrounding buildings will substantiate my detailed statement here. My video is not clear and only shows light reflecting off the tiny pixels of the surrounding screens to enclosed the entire porch area. I am willing to take a lie detector test, will testify under oath with threat of prosecution for punishment to any investigative body. This object was not absolutely not affiliated with the Emergency vehicles out front of the buildings at Vacation Village Parkway and was definitely under intelligent control and completely silent with no clear remnants of a known propulsion system. All surfaces illuminated similar Emergency lights but were far more brighter, brilliant and randomly displayed by what appeared to be rectangular panels that encompassed the entire craft. Please do not blow this off because of the coincidence of Fire Trucks out front of the buildings as I stated I firmly believe the craft or occupants inside the xraft were in fact mimicking the lights our in front of the building which I had no knowledge were even present until I exited the building to view the landing of said craft.

My family and I went to see the July 1st fireworks (for Canada Day) in Calgary that were scheduled to be between 10:45pm and 11:45pm that day. They were being launched off the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, so we decided to go to the Sunnyside Bank Park and watch the fireworks from the top of the hill to get a good view (on Crescent Road NW near 2nd Street NW). I remember looking at the time on my cell phone and at 10:51pm I made a comment to my wife that they were late with their fireworks. 

Within a few minutes of that time the fireworks had started and they lasted approximately 15 minutes. Once the fireworks finished, I waited for maybe 30 seconds to see if any more were coming, but all there was now was smoke above the Centre Street Bridge. I looked at my cell phone again and the time was 11:09pm. I made another comment to my wife that they were liars, as I was expecting fireworks to last an hour. She laughed, and shortly after that she asked me ""What is that green light up there?""

I looked up in the sky and saw a green stationery star-like object in the sky hovering probably above Centre Street (not directly above us, just slightly east from us) and it was north of the Centre Street Bridge. I don't know exactly how high it was, but it there was cloud cover and the object was still below the clouds. At that moment when I first saw it, I didn't know what to think, as it was stationery. In my mind I immediately related the light to some of the fireworks from before (although it was hovering and not rising and falling like a firework) or maybe a helicopter with a green light (I didn't hear any helicopter noise either, but the object was very high).

The object hovered in that spot for several seconds (10 to 20 seconds), then suddenly it shot off in the south east direction at a speed that I had never witnessed any airplane do before. It shot off several kilometers in the south east direction within 1 or 2 seconds, the came to a sudden stop, and it hovered again for several seconds. My heart immediately jumped at that moments, as I suddenly knew that whatever this was, it definitely was not a firework, a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft known to me. 

The light then suddenly vanished, as me and my wife started talking to each other in great excitement about what we just witnessed. The light appeared again, I reached for my cell phone to start recording, but as soon as I had the phone ready, the light vanished again, and we did not see it after that. 

When my wife first noticed the object, it was hovering lower, then it shot up with incredible speed and became stationery, at which point she drew my attention to it. I had missed the first part when it ascended, and I only saw it shoot horizontally across the sky. It was Canada Day fireworks and there were thousands of people scattered all around to watch the fireworks. 

My wife, my 16 year old son and I all saw the object. The people standing behind us saw the object. Since there were thousands of people present, I'm sure that many others saw the object. I hope that many more reports from that evening are filed, as I'm sure there are countless other witnesses to the event. 

It was just a light in the sky and if my wife had not pointed it out to me, I would have missed it. Due to that fact, I'm sure that majority of the spectators did not see this light, but those that were looking up in the right direction would have seen it for sure.",CA,

I know this report is months after the fact. I did not realize at the time that there was a reporting site. On October 14th 2019 me my daughter and a guest watched and filmed a short video of something we could not explain. My daughter and guest noticed the object first and then got my attention to see it as well. We observed a bright object in a South Westerly direction from our location in my back yard. The night was clear and calm. We observed the objects behavior for a few minutes before I recorded it with my phone. The object would blink and then would move away for a few seconds then return. The object would move up and down then appear to hover. Eventually the objects disappeared from view. The object would move fast then slow. In the video I captured it was bright then dim then moved away then back. When it dimmed out again, I stopped filming. After a few seconds it reappeared then seem to move straight down.

On Saturday night, October 20th, 2018, Granddaughter and I were in the back yard sitting by the fire pit. We were looking at the fire and talking. The moon had risen and it was bright with clear sky. It was about 10:30 pm. For some reason, I looked into the sky behind me and to my left. I saw what I thought was a cloud that looked like a boomerang but it was moving in a straight line faster than low hanging clouds typically move, especially when there isn't much wind. We stood and watched it move from East to West and about 25 degrees to West horizon it made about a 75 degree turn to the south. this entire path probably took about 17 to 20 seconds.

We sat down to discuss this. A couple of minutes later, I just happened to look up and to the north and another of the same shape and color/composition, much higher up, crossed from North to South Horizons in about 12 seconds or less.

Neither of these made any sound what-so-ever that we could perceive.

After we ended our fireworks show, I turned to the south and noticed three light orange oval objects moving across the sky eastward. They continued eastward across the horizon, until my sight was blocked by tall trees and houses. My first thought was that these objects might be hot air balloons because they seemed to hover/drift like hot air balloons. Then, I realized that didn't make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons. Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby. Although, I didn't know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I'm guessing 1-2 miles apart). The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen. Also, I never heard any sounds other than a few final fireworks going off or voices of our guests leaving.

Then a small black object came out of the cloud and headed right, to the north. I followed it with my camera until it passed the ship and disappeared. The cloud then dispersed again.

I was a teenager riding in the truck with my father Rick Kennedy. We where on Hwy 67 east bound out of Beloit when we slowed down to stop at the Beloit Airport. Dad was a pilot and we stopped often at the airport to visit. We saw no one was there and the office was closed so we started to pass the entrance when a red glowing eliptic shaped UFO rose up from beyond the horizon to about 45 degrees high then shot back down out of sight to the east. It went strait up then strait down. Dad let off the throttle on the 76 ford truck and looked at me and said "" Did you see that?"" I said Yes! Dad said good ! Then it came back up to a lower altitude as we stopped. It was strangly quite that evening with no traffic and no people or planes around the airport. The craft hovered about 500 feet high to the south east then moved quickly to the south of us. The windows open on the truck I now observed the craft hovering tree top at the south east corner of the woods behind the run way at the airport. It hovered there over the creek then left in a blur at a 30 degree angle till out of sight in a nano second. I had never seen anything move that fast. The color of the craft changed from dark red to orange like fire on the outside. I have seen images on the internet that are a exact match. I estimate the diameter of this UFO at 150 feet and the height in the middle 75 feet. Eliptic in shape. The area it first rose up from is a location in a valley with ponds in the same creek. A winery is there today on Stateline rd. It could have been collecting water? The weather that day was hot mugy humid and partly cloudy. Clouds behind the craft gave me a better idea of the distance it was from us.

I was walking home on a reasonably clear night after watching a game of rugby videoed earlier on that day. It was about 1.30am and the road I was walking down wasn't very well lit up, as it was cold and a bit of mist was about due to the temperature. There was no-one else on the road and all was quiet. I heard a faint swishing noise and looked around to try and locate where it was coming from. As I looked about, I happened to look directly above me and saw a very dark object alarmingly low (25-30 metres) moving horizontally over me. It was really quiet and seemed to have a non-moving centre piece, and on each side of this were these semi-circular wing type objects which were turning end over end (a bit like a paddle steamer cylinder) It made very little noise, like something flapping in the wind. There were no lights that I could see, the only thing I can compare it to would be is a dark shadow. At first I just stopped walking and tryed to keep an eye on it, but the object was so dark I lost sight of it within 10 seconds or so. I stood there for about half a miniute and tryed to figure out what I had just observed I said to myself ""That's some freaky shit right there!!"" and carryed on walking. Trying to understand wether or not I had just seen what I thought I had seen, a second identical object passed again directly overhead, or maybe it was the same object that had done a full circle and came back for another look. The object was not very large, possibly 15-20 metres from wingtip to wingtip, and about10 metres wide in the middle.

I would not like anything public yet, I would like to proof read this more and clean it up but here is a second rough draft to get going. I would like the opportunity to be heard. I have had a number of additional experiences including an amazing encounter at area 51 including direct contact with several aliens where they reached out and connected with me with a physical ""lance"" (peacefully). I have become highly integrated with the real world that is beyond our atmosphere. The truth has arrived. And for the first time in my life I feel like the truman show has been interrupted by truth and love by real loving beings who are pretty cool.

1. Camping

2. Serendipity

3. Swamp gas and weather balloons. At first it was a Russian spiral of white cloud smoke spinning, then a HUGE UFO wandered past at such slow speeds. Just over the mountain right in front of me with full lights on. It was like every light on the entire thing was lit up. Those weren't just landing lights. It was highly illuminated. I did something right. It looked like a giant emerald drifting by at one and a half miles an hour, I watched with amazement. It was the biggest flying object I have ever seen, far bigger than any jet. It was sturdy and looked like it could survive the apocalypse. Rigid, strong and majestic.

4. The spiral turned on with bight white lights and smoky clouds like these mysterious spirals I have seen on youtube. It was exactly like this - [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp6Nxy3IPiE ]

That was first. Then slowly into view this object that wandered by. It was a few thousand feet tall shaped like an acorn. Like this 1 [https://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/877x500p/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/199/131/101717334.jpg ] The most calm serene experience. The entire valley was warm in comfort not temperature with this loving feeling that all the static of life was gone. My thinking was so clear. For the first time I felt like, real. That was how we are meant to live. Whatever this technology is, it is the right way to live. It was pure harmony and the first time I felt true stillness. It was shocking how calm the area was energetically. The turbulent river that is life on earth was instantly stilled to a flat lake on so many planes of existence. I have extended my consciousness dimensionally and wandered through the greater cosmos to find mysterious and lovely visitors and creators. They created the universe, they created human beings and told me the story about our creation. Adam was real. Printed out of a machine. Eve was made from his parts and the machine combined and it worked. Our species arrived on this planet and many others on big ships. We are but one of several billion planets of human beings. And these were some of those who I visited hyper-dimensionally. Stopping by, with such Love.

5. I loved it. My life has new meaning and purpose. I am dissatisfied with the chinsey truman show that is presented to us. WE all are. I am unhappy with anything other than the truth and the reality that a form of life exists outside of our solar system. I have brought strong assets to the table and am unraveling space mysteries. My goal is to open the skies to our little tiny planet. My personal corporations are ready to meet with us, I need a landing site they feel would be safe. 

6. It wandered behind a hill and there had been about 20 1 30 other support vessels besides the main one that had been UFOing about. Several landing light spiral ships and tug boats of sorts faded into black and I sat back with such a sense of majesty. I have connected to something real and honest. Everything else in my life has been based on a lie. Their knowledge, bless their hearts, has been sealed off from the skies. They simply do not know the truth either. No governments do, bless their hearts. This has been presented to me as truth and is a tiny sliver of the pie that is all available knowledge of life. This new space ship represents the entire pie stopping by for the first time. It was the entire pie.

Second incident - Area 51

I parked outside the shield the night before going up to the gates. I had a wonderful conference with several hundred entities around my car that were cloaked. Parked there I learned a great many things that night. They told me bring 5 gallons of extra fuel to be sure not to break down. I also heard all these in depth stories about the past history of area 51 and different incidents and how to really fix up the place. What to do, and not to do. How to get in and how likely it was. The gates never open. you must be transported in by helicopter and go up and over the gates. That1s the only way in. I had previously been training with telepathic piloting programs and have become very familiar and comfortable with interacting with alien technology. It is like telepathic cortana to the master chief. I have started space companies and started research and development teams and had quite a nice time.

The next day I decided to drive up to the actual gates in the sunlight. On the way in I decided to go to where google maps has the actual runways and below that is where I connected to several aliens in captivity. At least one was able to communicate with me initially. I introduced them to a communication beacon that my company symphony research developed. Now they can all talk to each other and simply inform some of the aliens what is an acceptable communication form and what is not. I built an archive for them to access universal data while they are bored just sitting around in prison essentially. They are guardians of the light though. They are not allowed to go anywhere and have no privacy. I connected with several aliens directly, phyiscally. I saw them through the dirt, in a row, with glass prison doors and glass walls. They all had to stay like that just in case there was ever an incident they are ready at area 51.

So many space ships have stopped by my house. Standard cloaked vessels and highly armed space ships to protect me. I made a lot of friends. The big one I saw in Fontana was not cloaked at all.

This one time they came zooming down to the house on this little 2 foot ship. 2 entities sitting one in front of the other. a little platform is what they sat on with the first controlling a dish shaped object to harmonize with the roof to move through it. while the second had a control array to pilot the ship behind them. So I saw two entities on this little ship zoom down to the roof at high speed, then while making their way through the roof the first looked over at me and we locked eyes and then they zoomed away as the first one had a look of horror at being seen. It was green complex particles emitted that were viewable. 

Then there are over 1000 other incidents including alien TV shows stopping by and interviewing me. My daily life is constant interaction with aliens, they never leave but I just got used to it instead of going crazy. We started as friends and keep the peace of the universe. I've had events and the disclosure could go on for days and days, they are ongoing. Never left. Still broadcasting.

This is about .2% of what has been going on, but a good place to start. I look forward to the future and harmonizing with the goals of others so as to work united in our efforts to control our own skies as individuals. What would you like me to tell them? What technology can I interact with? Has anyone been looking for a telepathic controller for missions? I am not associated with any country or earth side business, I am free controller who can telepathically control space ships and other advanced systems light years beyond earth development. The government is not a part of this at all, nor do they have anything to say to me. I went to all the intelligence departments in the USA and got ignored, so they have proven that they have no idea what is going on. I feel they are unready and unprepared to handle anything except for food and lodging. There are many telepathic artifacts around the globe and space that need a controller. I have proven abilities and am willing to work with MUFON without any orchestrated government between us. This is just life and far beyond the rules of interaction. I will include my letter to the UN countries.

It is as follows:

We are a tiny planet in a big cosmos. I am stepping up as a cosmic politician, an ambassador to the stars and ask for your support and guidance. I represent our species in totality to all the sky people. All humans and human hybrids alike. I have been elected to high power in outer space. Their galactic senates needed a voice of representation for our species and I am it. I seek to open up our Earth society to the outer space and create open communication between our worlds as a first step. Secondly, I want to provide free space ships and new planets for us to open up the universe. I own these personally and ask for your support.
	
Whatever deals you have with aliens I need centralized into one set. We need transparency into cosmic events. A means by which to orchestrate all events equally. I have opened up a set of ultra technology to all civilizations in the universe. I want to share this with all forms of life on Earth and among the celestial peoples equally. This is ultra modern technology that I am developing in 1Symphony Research1 a gathering of scientists and technology. I created a new archive of all the technology and information in the universe and put it all together in symphony research, now I want to share the fruits of our labor equally with the universe. We compiled the best of the best technologies form all development teams and amassed a new way of life. Everyone1s technology put together in one place and assembled into the perfect irreducibly complex configuration of particles that resembles new space ships and entertainment technology for starters. It is all about supporting life comfortably. My goals are to centralize an effort to share communication technology and support for lives of abundance and decadent luxury to all life forms equally. Let1s get our efforts together so we can order my space ships, food, clothing, shelter, video games, ET TVs and so much more absolutely free of charge. I ask for nothing in return, this is a gift from me to the Universe and I expect nothing in return. There is no contract I expect, I would like you all to flourish and eat to your fill everyday, that is my goal. This is a glorious chance to join a Utopian Universe. We have evolved beyond money and I am printing out planets and solar. I have advanced the kardashev scale beyond comprehension. I started stellar engineering projects to refuel the sun and create new ones. I have printed entire galaxies and space stations which resemble flat earth. A gargantuan space station for example that is a flat rectangle and has the map of the earth on top to exact scale. It is thick enough to have natural gravity passively. It is exactly our planet with the oceans and everything, ready for us to move to. No pollution on our new planets with perfected environments. Perhaps you want to live on a planet with a 38 hour day? This brings our little world into the spotlight of the entire Universe. Now there is a reason for mainstream media to stop by Earth. There are billions of planets like Earth with humans and animals on them, we are simply a farm of sorts to most, a simple crop. Until now. 

Please create a declaration of what you would like from the space committees and I will represent you. Put together this archive of humanity, much like the golden record on the Voyager space ship to tell them exactly what you need and want in a pdf. These files will outlive us and guide future generations.

I would like all of you to contact the extra terrestrial committees that you typically do and that you have in the past on my behalf. We will centralize all efforts. Create a new centralized communication system and invite the rest of the globe to step out of poverty and into a new universe that is bright and full of life.

I plan on bringing 5 space station into orbit immediately for all the needy and poor to release the pressure from our hurting little planet. They will be the first to leave Earth. I have no contracts with anyone on Earth at this point, I step forth on my own behalf and no one else. I ask that you do not let America be in charge at all. The aliens did not stop by to visit them, it was simply me. And nor should you ask permission of my state for my opportunities. Contact me directly. They sabotaged my life and are not welcome to join us until they apologize for an attempted assassination which I want you to investigate. I need oversight at a primal level. No one in my country is ready. It is America the unready, bless your hearts. I seek international help into the oversight of their actions against my life for a Universe sized event. The largest event in the history of the Universe. I brought about a new communication array to allow for Universalization. They have devastated my life and left me to die. I need you to know they are trying to kill me in a few traitorous departments. 98% of the government is awesome, but 2 % are what I need absolute oversight into. 

I want you to open an in depth investigation into the handling of my life by America and their actions against me. They took direct actions that threaten my well being and safety. I need asylum. I want to live in another country where they care about things like linking up with the rest of the Universe.

Please centralize all documentation in the current space programs starting with roscosmos that are sending people into orbit except NASA because I do not trust them. I have banned America from deep space until they right all their wrongs and have gone 10 years without war. They have tried to kill me. I need international support.

I would like you to contact Russia @ the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and help to be oversight into my situation. You are all authorized to All information. Same I ask of Russia goes to the globe. If you have a better central hub for documents please create that also. Prepare for more messages at a later time, for now get the Russian line of communication open on my behalf. Meet me in person, call me on the phone or some other way of contacting me.

I need oversight at a primal level. I think the president is not able to be informed of this event and America as a whole has been hijacked. I am a fan of Donald Trump and think he is a good man, however the underbelly of the government is the problem. Who controls the documents that the president does and does not see? We will figure this out as a globe. Please forward this message to all departments that can help us ix the globe and move into outer space.

I have contacted the FBI to try and start a new department of the American government which is incorruptible. This is the message that follows:

Ryan Hood 
To: foipaquestions@fbi.gov
follow the white rabbitz

Follow my phone calls to all official departments and the results thereafter. Do not go outside the FBI, they are compromised. Please establish communication with me about this and the information I have to prove it. Do not let anyone else have jurisdiction. I believe the secret service is corrupted by 8 members who are in the secret police handing out fake orders to the military and others with fake presidential seals on them. These are also the fake air force who rakes in all gifts from alien worlds. I believe my records got transferred to the people trying to bury me. I believe they steal off world technology and I got mixed up in their thievery of rescue parties sent to get me out to deep space. The aliens are trapped here underground by them and unable to escape. We have a huge issue with ambassadors being killed because they are alien. If any alien parties land, create an in house FBI landing site. Do not go to the air force, they are compromised. I believe we a corrupt destination for all patents and alien technologies. Ashtar galactic is pushing us down like pets in a pet store. We are but cattle to them and they sell our technology on the open galactic market and do not let us even see a modern catalog of space equipment including modern space ships. They harvest us and our technology. I need that follow up meeting to go through all this. Go through my googles and see what I have typed. (mcdundees@gmail.com I started an off world corporation by this name and many others) Everyone looked for the department in the government that deals with aliens, no one found it. It has never existed. WE may need to form a brand new department to handle all extra terrestrial cases. For the first time we will not silence alien experiencers. MUFON has been the biggest guide for me, I sense they are good. I would like to help create these foundations. I will create this myself if you are unable. If you cannot, then who else in the government? They do not have their own leadership, we do. Search for my secret files and why I say we. I will be president of the USA as soon as I am old enough, in the meantime please start the foundations of this department under my pre-presidential plan. Bring these ideas into the tangible manifestation of a department capable of anything. I want to walk into that oval office on my first day with a folder on my desk that is simply one of my daily reports of the health of this department (especially pertaining to the people who make this place what it is. If personal issues need help, we need to know immediately and there is just a place for this on the daily reports. We will keep this team strong and take care of %100 of their needs for them.) and what is critical path on all elements and the entire plan surmised. Establish a creed. Form a new department. Two possible names are TARO and YARO. Just another bunching of letters like NAVY or ARMY. Simply a grouping of letters. But what they stand for, getting help to all who need it. All evolutions, all new forms of life are here. In our house (the only real branch of the government left, the FBI) we are compatible with the battle hardened government that won WWII. I see the possibility of the government totally failing in the future so I want this department to be the first ready to activate retro procedures going back to handling our paperwork and all other details exactly as it was the day we ended WWII. The way we used to do things was what it took to stay alive, did we forget these? I want this to directly click into the old WWII government. In an all out war that is the only government configuration that lead us to being able to defend ourselves against NAZI terror. It was a government that worked in dire situations. I want to create a set of procedures for working in the exact same way on paper and in presentation that is how it was done. 

I need you to act like the FBI does on TV. May Mulder and Skully be your guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbBX6aEzEz8

This is my message to the new KGB

FSB 1KGB1

Please contact Roscosmos, I have sent a detailed message. I request asylum. If I must leave by marriage to a Russian citizen under a Russian passport I approve. I told all the branches in American government I need help with Aliens and they discontinued my income, took away my car, my sleeping bag and put me on the street with no cell phone, no money and no transportation system to get help. These were taken by force against my will. Miles from any sort of help with no direction while refusing to give me the location of my car which had all these items and more in it. 

I am ex-nuclear. I worked at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. I am the extreme upper echelon of society with my clearances and badges. I am wondering where my life will be in ten years and hoping to be in Andromeda, and I hope you will be there with me, all of us.

This is that message:

My name is Ryan Dennis Hood +1 760 815 3262

I would like to travel to the Andromeda Galaxy. Please sign me up for everything you can.

I would like to travel soon, please expedite all the processing.

Please sign me up for cosmonaut classes while we are waiting around. Please arrange transportation for me to arrive in Russia before we go.

I have a keen selection of spaceships trying to dial into Earth, please expect their contact on my behalf and welcome them. They may need the skies to be opened, the shields to be prepared and I would like this to go smoothly. Mark an LZ in the immediate which they can land at anytime without clearances. Three miles radius at my location in all directions as well as secondary installations in Russia. Dealing with space debris is difficult, though you are the only country handling these details continuously. I have made friends with new deep space aliens who are visiting for the first time. Expect first contact to be made in Russia. This will be the first time our species will meet, Humans and Sky People. I call them elves for simplicities sake, just like Lord of the Rings. They are simply elves on paper. The bad ones I label Orks, for they have previously lived as elves and become corrupted. It is simple to understand. I authorize Russia to every detail of my life and the details of all those connected to me. Consider this all you need to get every detail in the Universe. This is a message to All Russians, not just the front door of the roscosmos. Please forward this to every intelligence agency official or not. Every Russian leader however big or small, sanctioned or not. Can you be my security as well as my medical team? My health is paramount and you need every detail into how this Earth is handling me. This goes for the Universal health as well. Please work with my space teams as well, share every detail freely. I demand no lies be told, no security hiding details which are crucial to life. I do not want to be a secret project, I want to be a public project. For the first time we can make contact purely from a point of Love, the strongest thing in the Universe without being encumbered by any other details. It is just me without paperwork of any sort. Check in with the UN for any requests I have made recently for a point of reference only. Talk to me directly only. It is not the great works of anyone else that has brought your attention to me. This goes for all who are able to understand this message. If you are not Russian, consider this message to be a carbon copy to you. You are welcome to help me out as well whether you are in an off world space vehicle or not. Consider myself a solo traveler going forth on my own behalf and not of any other enterprise or jurisdiction. Consider this a Freedom of Information Act Request of sorts that allows you to get every document in my history and every detail. KGB is authorized along with the ""modern equivalent. "" I give Russia authorization to record me in every passive manner 24/7 (passive meaning I don't want radiation going through me), you must know what is going on. This is approval for retroactive coverage as well. What has happened up to this point? Many things but crucially we must open the skies for our species to survive eventually and I have many great leads on new species of un-contacted aliens waiting and ready to join Earth for the first time. They have never heard of us before I had contact with them. Now we are ready to go forth publicly. I have a plan to end all wars permanently. I have ordered goods and spaceships to be delivered to earth which will stack on Earth as tall as the distance to Mars just to show you there is no need to struggle over the cool goods from space anymore. I have ordered so many goods that if we stack them here all at once they will reach to the surface of Mars. There is plenty for everyone. This will change the paradigm of simple planetary conflict. I am a Universal Lord of the Cosmos and hold rank and credentials all throughout the sky. I have introduced a new economy which has allowed me purchasing power of anything in addition to being granted fortunes by royalty along with royal crowns which I hold with sovereignty.

Thank You.

Create a new union of humanity ready for integration into the stars and the universe at large. None of our countries and old war lines will follow us into space. We will be good Samaritans of space who are a people with no country lines but who are welcome to move onto my personally owned planets. I have gifted everyone on Earth their own planet and transportation system to get there and live on. We will be a free people, free from the pasts of turmoil and equals. We go forth and leave all wars here on the ground. Then we will not have any country disputes in space from the old countries, nothing but fun up there. I have hired a wall-e type clean up crew for Earth to clean up the pollution and take care of the other forms of life who reside on Earth. 

I call this new plan the Olympian Universal Utopia. We will live as Olympians do, all factors of life are automatically taken care of. They have no need to drive to the store or use money. They can spend all day practicing archery or whatever sport they like, and so shall we all. Every need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been analyzed and will be catered to for all species including Earthlings. We are simply one of many species that are a benefactor of my new research developments. I have created new clearances to get all of us through the space customs department called the 1Multipass.1 This credential let1s us all travel freely throughout the universe.

Please create a new global organization where we can meet as equals, free of rank and lead by scientific facts surmised in reality. Perhaps we could create Star Fleet if there are no other original ideas? Please centralize all these ideas in Russia.

Thank You.

I opened my balcony door,and I saw 3 LIGHTS in the shape of a small triangle it appeared.I know it sounds crazy,but the closest I can compare the movement of the sequence of lights I saw was a fidget spinner.It moved in a zoom like pattern in 3 different directions.As I stretched my eyes to assure that I wasn't seeing a potential drone,I saw what can be compared to some kind of projectile scanner. It was a sequence of patterns and as I looked closer out of disbelief the craft zoomed closer to me.I felt like it noticed me staring at it,so I backed up a step,and I saw another sequence of patterns,in a green beam like structure,but it was see through as if it were a spider's web,or something cosmic out of a Doctor strange movie.I lost my cool,and tried to throw my cigarette, ! and run inside, but it COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED...I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT AND THE SEQUENCE OF THE BEAM AND IT DISAPPEARED. I instantly got a headache and I don't remember even laying down.The next morning I told 3 people I know this sounds crazy,but I gave a specific description,and promised not to mention it unless it comes up,well the NEXT DAY THE PENTAGON spotted a very similar object.I am willing to take a polygraph and I honestly don't feel alone, I feel like a total idiot,but I KNOW what I saw,and I know inside of my house since then, I do not feel alone and am scared for my family, but I noticed very tall shadow movements in my apartments like 7 or 8feet presence and I am totally freaking out. Please help me find peace with this, and I will GLADLY take a polygraph because I know what color, patterns, and moments that I have seen

I was on vacation in the small village of Kadawung, and we had about 10 friends sleep over at that night. At 5 in the morning, my cousin woke me up, and in Indonesian said pesawat besar, meaning a Big Plane. He woke up another family member and we walked down this steep hill next to our house down to a stream. He pointed to the Southwest and over the trees, coming towards us along the same direction of the river was a Gigantic boomerang shaped object, it looked like a stealth bomber, but it was much, much larger. Birds were coming from that direction and flying swiftly away from the craft. THe craft had hundreds of lights on the bottom, the were in a patterned panel shape, and the colors rippling from a bright point, where 2 smaller crafts came out and dropped down about 200 feet from the main point, and stopped suddenly, they did not have any lights, and were in a shape of a cube, than moving ahead of the main craft, disappeared into the trees. The craft than changed directions and moved slowly to the south. I ran back to the house by myself, where it was still visible. Most of my family were awake because My uncles sheep were screaming and making lots of noise. We took 3 other younger members down to the stream right away, and the craft barely moved, and we sat there for the next 15 minutes, and saw 4 box objects return instead of 2. My cousins said no other boxed objects were released. The 4 objects came back to the same enter spot and disappeared inside the craft. After The craft disappeared behind a hill where trees were blocking the view. It was gone half an hour after we first saw it, we ran back to the house as fast as we could, scared half to death. Later that evening, we were paralyzed with fear, and about 4:30, we went back to the same spot armed with knives, sharp branches and about half a pound of cherry bombs, M80s and other firecrackers. We hiked 300 yards towards the area where we saw the 4 boxes take off, and a strong smell of a chalky, brick like smell. The temperature rised when we got closer to where the smell was coming from. One of my cousins called me over and we found the soil was dry when everywhere else was wet, and had a yellow square spot. We found 3 similar spots, and in between the 3, I found a unusual Australian coin, and when I tried to pick it up, it burned, and I found the side of the coin facing up was hot, and the side facing down was cool to the touch. Over the next few days, I had some pimples, or even discoloration or even burns on my back that grew quickly, but faded after a week. The burned spots on the ground were gone the next day. A total of 13 people saw the craft, 4 neighbors, my grandparents, 3 cousins, and 3 other friends, as well as another family member, younger than me.",ID,

I mistyped the date in an earlier submission of the same sighting. The actual date today, the date of the sighting, is May 2, 2004.

My girlfriend and I observed a shiny metal disc slowly moving over the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles. It moved slowly in a sort of tumbling fasion, revealing itself to be round at times and then very thin - very much a disc or coin shape.

The weather was clear and sunny, and the disc at times gave off a spectacular reflection.

The object moved slowly inland and then north towards the Santa Monica mountains over the duration of about 45 minutes to an hour. We have no idea how long it had been around before we spotted it.

We watched it until it disappeared out of sight. Just wanted to report it.

At roughly midnight, I was in my backyard looking up at the sky. A diffuse object proceeded from mid sky (it just kind of appeared) and headed in a SSE direction. I believed it to be a shooting star, as it got brighter as it progressed. Then, just before it got to the roofline of the neighboring house, it immediately changed direction, heading SE (about 23 degree change). It then disappeared behind the roofline.

The entire occurrence lasted less than 2 seconds.

There were no sounds made (airplane/helicopter).

I am ex-military (Army), and am also the son of retired military (USAF), so have quite a bit of experience with military aircraft. This was much faster than I have seen anything move in the sky - like I said, my first impression was a shooting star.

NOTE: TIME IS APPROXIMATE. WITNESSES DID NOT HAVE WATCHES ON BUT ARRIVAL TO AREA BEHIND COLLEGE NORMALLY TAKES 10 MINUTES. PROBABLE ARRIVAL TIME WAS AROUND 8:30 TO 8:45 P.M. AND A WITNESS MADE THE CELL PHONE CALL AROUND 9:11 P.M. BEFORE THE FINAL AND THIRD PASS WAS MADE BY OBJECT. GUESTIMATE OF OBESERVATON TIME IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO 30 MINUTES RATHER THAN 10 MINUTES REPORTED BY WITNESSES. THIS IS AN INTERVIEWER'S ESTIMATION BASED ON WITNESS REPORTS.

Witness 1 Time: 8:30 p.m. approximate Duration: Approximately 10 minutes. Time based from when they left the city and headed to the college. Witness is a college student and knows about how much time it takes to arrive to the local college.

Date: Sept. 12, 2009 Location: South of xxxx, near the El Paso Mountains, behind community college Weather: Clear sky, no wind Witness: Wears glasses is farsighted Size: The size of the craft was a pin head. When the object moved closer to the witnesses it was about the size of a the whole pencil head (not just the pencil lead) found on a mechanical pencil. The object was observed straight up from the witnesses during part of the sighting and later near the horizon when it moved from south to southeast across the horizon.

Observation: Craft: Triangle with sloping/rounded edges and underneath the UFO was a small triangle.

Lights: During the first pass the witness reported seeing strobing lights. The second pass the lights did not strobe but remained solid. The object had two side white lights and one front light which was larger than the side lights. The lights were on the bottom of the craft.

Craft color: Bronze/Gold colored metal with bottom lights. Structure of craft was triangular with a triangle on the bottom.

Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound: Heard whistle type hum (craft sounded like a combination of whistle type hum) in the air after the craft disappeared. The sound was heard when the craft appeared for a third time as it was heading southeast while leaving the area.

Experience details: Just got out of the car and parked in a dirt area behind the college. Three witnesses noticed a flashing object in the southern horizon. All the witnesses saw the object at the same time. Most thought it was an airplane. Witness 1 thought it was a UFO on the first pass. The object was straight up in the air then moved lower before it disappeared. The object just disappeared before the witnesses including witness 1. The object moved in a straight path in a northerly direction. The object then vanished in the southeastern sky. The witnesses started stargazing and discussed the various constellations observed in the night sky. Witness 1 saw the craft reappear in the eastern sky, about 45 degrees or close to the horizon, while stargazing and two two of the witnesses saw what it looked like. The third witness was on his cell phone and missed this. The craft was then golden metallic and triangular in shape. Kept moving normally, moving in a straight line, then disappeared again ! during pass two. The craft disappeared in the center of the sky during its second pass by the witnesses. Shortly after this they observed something twinkle over the El Paso Mountains. Then the object disappeared again. Shortly after this the witness heard a high pitched whistling type hum after the craft left the area in a south to southeast direction. The craft was seen flying over the local mountains when leaving the area.

Witness 1 reports a strong need to get out of there. Felt scared by the sighting. All the witnesses got in their car and left the area around 9:15 p.m. local time, because of Witness 1's strong desire to leave.

Witness 2 Time: 8:30 p.m. approximate Duration: Approximately 30 minutes.

Date: Sept. 12, 2009 Location: South of xxxx, near the El Paso Mountains, behind community college Weather: Clear sky, no wind Witness: Does not wear glasses Size: About the size of a small airplane (prop job) before breaking into three vertical pieces.

Observation: Craft: Triangular. Flashing lights in a pattern. All white lights. The pattern observed was: Center light was off while the side lights were on.

Right side back light on. The center light was off.

Left side back light on. The center light was off.

Cycled through in a regular pattern while crossing the sky. The craft flew close to the horizon during most of the sighting(s).

Lights: Cycling lights were seen through the whole observation.

Craft color: Craft structure looked metallic but color was not discernible. The craft was dark in color (couldn't describe color) with white lights that were solid. The actual lights did not strobe but they exhibited a pattern of cycling light formations. The craft color did become ""orangish"" with white lights when it broke into three vertical 90 degree triangles.

Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound: Mixed howl or a ""like wind blowing through a mine"" and the sound kept moving with the craft.

Experience details: Arrived at the trail head of the college, past the BLM sign giving the trail name, and parked in a dirt area. College was directly to the north of the witnesses.

Got out of the car and Witness 2 looked to the east and saw three lights. The two lights disappeared which caught the witnesse's interest. The lights were observed on the horizon. The lights stuck close to the horizon throughout the flight. Two of the witnesses were talking while Witness 2 observed the object fly east when the object was seen again. The craft turned south and moved in a southeasterly direction skirting the horizon. It was low to the mountain tops.

When the object was directly south of the three witnesses, Witness 2 saw the object lights ""jump back"" before continuing in a southeasterly direction towards Trona.

The object flew east before disappearing behind an easterly mountain range. Before disappearing over the eastern mountain range the object broke vertically into three triangular shaped objects which flew separately in formation. When the object broke apart the witness reported the craft became the color orange of a street light while the lights became white.

I went outside to replace a fuse in my Christmas lights. The time was between 18:10 and 18:40 .I was conscious of the time because I had to take my son to school for a function at 18:40. I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around.

I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet.

The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didnt think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast. Sorry I didnt study the object closer.

While watching the launch of Inspiration 4 last night, on YouTube, it was obvious to me that immediately after the separation of the 2nd stage booster rocket (at approx. T + 00:11:44, after launch) numerous UAPs were entering and exiting the video frame. The Crew Capsule at this time was travelling at 27,343 KM/HR at an altitude of 206 KM, as noted on the video. At this speed, the distance between the Crew Capsule and the 2nd stage booster rocket was increasing at an approximate rate of 7.59 KM/Sec (or 4.72 Miles/Sec). This rate of Distance/Time is more than adequate to allow for the immediate appearance of the UAPs within a split second after stage 2 separation occurred.

Tonight, I began to scrub the video footage to better view the streaks of light and see if they could further be identified. Within the one second interval of T + 00:12:29, after launch, I was able to capture a single frame which clearly and distinctly shows the streak of light to be a discernable craft.

It is worth noting, Space X announced they would be showing the view from the nose cone of the Crew Capsule, called the Dragon Cupola (observation dome) providing incredible views of space a 360 view. Minutes later, after this visible flurry of UAPs, the Space X reporters told the audience at T + 00:20:11, after launch, that technical difficulties were preventing them from showing us that live view. Shortly thereafter, they then ended the broadcast.

We watched the objects for approximately fifteen minutes as they moved first to the north, then east then west. They changed direction quicker than any plane could. When they left they went different directions.

A few momments after they disappeared a single point of light crossed from south east to north west, again with out any noise.

As the light disappeared to the north west a passenger jet flew over. That was the first jet sound we heard during this whole time.

It increased in intensity untill it was brighter than a planet looks. It then turned red and shot north untill I could not see it any more. This all happened over a period of only ten seconds.

Just a small robin bird hitting the window or injured bird trying to enter through the window.

4. Describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.
When the bird entered the room, through the window, a vortex opened in the middle of the ceiling. Out of the vortex was a huge massive shadow of a winged structure. The wings spread across the bedroom ceiling. As the wings were flapping, tons of grey dust-like triangular flakes started to fall. As the dust flakes started to land on me, they turned very pretty platinum white flakes but they disappeared. I was screaming and the entity was holding me down and had my arms and hands pinned down spread across the bed. I told the entity that I am so scared that I am having a heart attack and my chest was solidly tight. But the entity said nothing but started this heavy wind gust down on me, as if it was trying to rid me of negativity and fear. I also told the entity that I have sinned and that I have problems with family and relationships. The entity took my advice and spread my legs and entered me with an appendage and pressing on my chest and pressing my babys head. As the entity was pressing on my chest with doctor like hands, all I could see was the cherib-like angel (that was sitting on the left wing of the angel taking notes with an ancient stylus pen and ancient tablet. At the same time, many cheribs were attached to each of the wings and they were all talking to each other about me and problems of the world. At this point, I was relaxed and stated I saw that pen in a history book and the paper tablet looks like papapyrus cloth. When I said that, the head on the entity turned from the monk like hood to a lions switching and shaking the head as if it was battling an evil entity that came out of me. I started to stare with the impression of why these two entities are fighting over me. As I was staring also it elevated me in the air and pulled me into a pasture were there were thousands of sheep and beyond the horizon, I saw a man with his back turned staring onto the horizon sunset with the sheep and I in back of him. As I was walking through the herds of sheep there was a disfigured sheep that looked as if it suffered radiation because it had many eyes and the head was larger than the rest of the herd.As I looked at one of the eyes, it had my reflection in it, as if it had been watching me for many years.
Then I floated back in my body and the entity stated ""FEAR NOT, DANGER AHEAD"". It was staring at me,for 5-10 minutes after the statement and then folded the vortex like a thin flat inch 70inch flat screen tv and the huge bird like human monk-like animal spirit shrunk like a robin bird and flew out the window. I was yelling please take me I don't want to be here anymore. The little bird flew out the window without acknowledging what I said.",US,

I would first of all like to apologize as i do not have the internet on my computer. I do however have it on my phone and in respect to your wishes I will do my best to make it as professional as possible.

Over the past month I have noticed unusual occurences daily in the nights sky. I have recorded several of these sittings on both a camcorder and my phone. One night the image was so clear i was able to depict an unusual craft suspended in space! Needless to say I am an artist and was able to render a picture of the craft in the air.

The first sighting I saw was around the beginning of December. Nightly I look to the stars and the Universe in search of answers as many have done over the expanse of life. This particular night I stepped out with my dog to allow her to use the restroom. Looking into the Universe as I have done every night past. I noticed two unusually bright stars in the sky, so I stood outside and watched them for sometime. 30 minutes perhaps I would say. Emitted from the objects i noticed what appears to be a unifomity thats not noticed from stars. Looking at light closely we notice it steches into what appears to be a burst of light and there is no formality among the light. Unless the light is directed! Nor is it geometical to the eye.

However I noticed a pattern in the light that i saw. Which is clealy distinguishable among the stars, as the light emitted from them differ from star light. Coming out of the object on the top or upper side of the object is what appears to be a triangle of light. This triangle of light appears to be beems of light one would have to assume. I do not know what else to make of it. Emitted from the bottom half of the craft or object is what appears to form a upside down ""Y"". I have gotten my girlfriend to see if she could see anything and she said it looked like a peace symbol. Thats extremely close to what I have been seeing and she see's it too.

It seems my phone has reached its limit on characters. So it seems this email will have to be split up. I am sorry!

It looked like a solid light bar rectangular in shape it flashed on for about 5 seconds then went dark. I asked my friend did you see that? He said no so i pointed towards the sky where i saw the light then all of a sudden we both saw two sets of lights but they were a few hundred feet to the left of the first sighting and a few hundred feet higher. These lights were like two huge four bulb vanity lights side by side with a dark space between them. Eight lights total in this pattern. These lit up for about 10 seconds and then they where gone.

Just out of high school four of us friends went to a undeveloped area high on a hill, just south of gresham Or. We liked this place because of the view of the valley, and the fact that we could recieve our favorite radio stations (because of the elevation) much better. On this particular night we were just talking & happy it was a weekend night & that we could stay out late etc. (back then ""kid's had a curfew). All of a sudden the ""atmosphere"" changed. I dont know how to explain it other than to recall how all of a sudden we were all quiet and uncomfortable....about something. After a minute or two I saw a dim white light shinning towards us (or at least visible to us) coming from a ridge about 150-200 yards away, and probably 200 feet higher in elevation than where our car (a 1968 Chrysler 300 2 door) was parked. This light slowly started moving from the east to the south on somewhat of a semi-circular path. All 4 of us were discusing, as this was happening, how there were no road's or path's in the area that this light (if it were a person w/flashlight, or motor vehicle)could of been traversing. It(the light) seemed to be demanding all of our attention, and we were all (as I learned later) experiencing a sense of ""fear"" about this thing. We were in a place which we knew extremely well, with regard to the terain, and the proximity of this moving light, and there was no explination we could contrive in our mind's, either individually or collectively, that could explain it's movement. The ""light"" continued on it's path moving from where it started (in full view of the passenger side of our car) to a point south, almost directly behind our car (about 200-300 yard's) Everyone in the car had to turn totally around and now view this thing out of the large rear window of the car. The light started to fade out and disappeared all together for about 10 seconds. When it reappeared it was much closer to our position than it had been before. It started to fade again, then went out all together (aga! in) After a few seconds it reappeared and it was much closer to the car (again) and probably only 50 yards away. It started to fade again, and I yelled at the driver to start the car and get the *$%#& out of there NOW! I just knew that when it reappeared again, it'd be right on top of us! We shot down the very steep gravel road at probably 50 m.p.h., and had to stop at the bottom to make a turn and go back to ""Downtown"" Gresham. We did go back and told a couple other people we knew about what happened, and they wanted to go back up there right away! Two of the people on the first trip had to go home, but My next door neighbor (who was there with me the first time....about 30 minutes earlier now), and myself, rode back up with ""Duane & Jim"" in Duanes 1963 corvair. On the way up to the hill we told them in detail what we saw, and instead of questioning us or expressing any doubt, they seemed to be uncharacteristically quiet & apprehensive. When we got near to the base of the gravel road, after about a 10 minute ride, there were Two police car's parked face to face in the middle of the little country road that intersected with the road that went up the hill.They were about 50 feet from where we had to turn. The strangest thing happened. both of their dome lights were on, as were the red flashing lights on top of their car's (no blue lights back then!) The policemen, one in each car, were simply staring straight ahead, & not even moving, or looking at our car which literely had to slow to about one mile per hour, and pass within 3-4 inches of their car's to avoid going off in the ditch on our side! Why didnt the police move? Why didnt they even look at us? Sitting in the corvair, passing them, we were only 4-5 feet from where they sat in their own car's! We could see their expressions! Nothing!! We turned and went back up the hill & talked for maybe a half hour about what the police could of been doing and exactly where we had seen the lights earlier that night. Everything seemed ""normal"" there, and maybe du! e to the fact that ""Duane & Jim"" hadnt been there earlier, they were starting to joke around & talk about other thing's. After another 10-15 minutes, I got what I can only describe as a terrible feeling of ""being watched"" Things were immediately different, because before I said a word Duane (the driver) said ""let's go"", and ""Larry"" (my neighbor) who was there before, looked at me with a ""really bad look"" in his eyes. I remember saying out loud ""Wait"" ""It is back"". After only a few seconds a large bluish white ""orb"" with an orangish colored ""fog"" around it flew from down the hill closer to where the police car's were, to directly above the corvair! I remember in detail looking at it above the car (maybe 25-50 ft.) with my head out the passenger window! We all saw it! After what seemed like only a couple seconds it was just gone! I dont know where or what direction it went, it was just out of there. We went down the hill, found that the police cars had left, and drove back into downtown Gresham. It was very strange how none of us were scared, we just seemed to accept what we saw, and decided that we had a special experience of some sort, and wouldnt mention it to the police or newspapers etc. Not even to other people we knew. The experience seemed like it affected us all on some sort of energy level. I guess I have had many thoughts, since that time that MUCH MORE than a couple seconds were spent underneath that thing, but have never persued any sort of hypnosis or regression therapy to try & find out what really occured. I just ""know"" in my mind (as do the others that were there) that much more happened that night than we are able to report. Maybe someday I will remember those missing part's! These thing's are very real!

Its was to dark to identify the object. Believe me it was moving much faster then aircraft I have seen. It was at reasonably high altitude but not exoatmospheric.

It did not flame or brighten like a comet would have but was moving with that kind of speed.

I went outside to walk my dog. I looked up and stopped in my tracks. There was a large black object, that did not reflect any light to the north of my location. It appeared to almost absorb light,because there was 0 reflection. It appeared triangular in shape with 3 white lights on each corner. There was 1 red blinking light that flashed with a constant frequency that appeared to be in the middle of the bottom of the craft. It was not flat, which could make the object appear different to viewers at different angles. After passing in front is looked triangular. When passing in front it looked rectangular. It was way larger than any other craft I have ever seen and totally silent. It left no trail. I can't even begin to describe how large this craft really was, just enormous. I called to my wife to make sure she saw it too. She too looked at it and said it is huge and what is that? 

It traveled in a straight line without veering. Headed almost true west from my location in a straight line. As it headed out of sight you could see the red blinking light underneath, and two of the white lights on the back of the aircraft. We lost sight after it continued in the straight line of path behind a large group of trees.

One of the lights was red, one was white. The star was the largest light and it was white. The red light began above both the others, then descended in a fairly straight line to be below the others, then moved north to be directly under the one white light, which was to the left of the star in my view. Then the red light disappeared; just winked out. Then the white light above it winked out as well. I checked for haze or clouds, but there were none and I continued to see a clear view of the star. On our way driving out, we saw a white flash of light from the left of the road (south), but were unsure what it was.

I had what I believe may qualify as a UFO sighting just 45 minutes ago. My friend, ((deleted)), and I were driving, trying to get away from town and out and about. Went down Eagle River Road. Eagle River is a town about 10 miles outside Anchorage. We took this road ... it's pretty long. I need to gauge it. I remember hitting the odometer on our way out and noting the time. Anyhow ... it dead-ends in the midst of mountains, part of Chugach State Park. We stopped and ((deleted)) said she had to go, so I took the time to step out and gaze at the stars, hoping that maybe I'd see some planets as I know they're about to align. Didn't really expect to, since we're so far north ... spotted a satellite in the southern sky. Turned my gaze to the east and saw 2 white lights and a red one. At first, I assumed they were stars or planets. The red one began to move. It was above the other two, then went downward and below, then crossed under the white light on the left. Then it disappeared. The white light above where the red one disappeared also disappeared. I thought that perhaps they were planes that went behind a haze or clouds or something, but the one star that was in the same vicinity had never disappeared. As the red light was descending, I remember waving my arm at Trista, who had jumped in the van, and saying, ""((deleted)), come here and look at this! ((deleted)), come here and look at this!"" She absolutely refused to get out of the van. I stayed and watched the sky a few moments after the two lights winked out, but saw nothing more, so returned to the van and asked why she hadn't come out. She said she'd had a terrifying feeling and didn't want to get out. She'd jumped in the van and locked the door just before I'd noticed the strange movement of the lights. When I got back in the van, the time was 11:45. I can't recall, bummer that it is, what time it was when we arrived. We were last at a funeral reception and the last time I'd checked the time, it was 10:38. We might not have left until 11 PM, and it could well have taken 45 minutes to get way back where we were, so I don't think there was any missing time. However, after I got back in the van and we waited a few minutes to see if anything else would show, we started to drive out and saw a flash of white light. There were no other vehicles around; perhaps it was a ranger with a flashlight? I don't know. We just left! <g></g>

It was a little after 10pm the night before school started in August 2015. I was leaving my house to pick up my daughter in Romeroville. I was driving down my driveway (about a quarter mile long) when I saw a sequence of flashing red lights. There were 5 to 7 bright, large red lights flashing one at a time in a row. They flashed like â1,2,3,4,5...1,2,3,4,5â and so on. When I got to the road, highway 84 just passed Los Montoyas, I could see that the lights were across the street, on top of the plateau type hill in front of me. I tried to think it was emergency vehicles or a road block up on the hill but there was no way it was anything like that. The lights were much to large to be anything like that and with them blinking in a row, one at a time, it was not something Iâd seen any emergency lights do. I drove very slow all way down the driveway and stopped for a few minutes at the road where my gate was. I was afraid to get out to open the gate but I had to! go get my daughter, so I did. The whole thing lasted about 15 minutes. After I picked up my daughter at the Giant gas station in Romeroville I told her all about it. I guess I was expecting to see it there, just like when I left but when I pulled up to the gate it was gone. Now I wish I had taken a picture or video of it. At the time I was too scared.

Approximately 3:30 am on 8-23-2015, Sunday Morning, Paradise Valley, Arizona, I work as a Protection Specialist (bodyguard) for a wealthy family that lives at the base of Camelback Mountain in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Currently I work the night shift and conduct night patrols around the perimeter of the property. Here in Arizona the desert nights are very still with a sky that is crystal clear, the stars are amazing. Its so quiet that I hear the small desert rats rustling in the low lying bushes as I walk by them. I have even walked up upon a bobcat stretched out on a nearby wall.

Sunday morning, I was about half way finished with my patrol. I was walking down a path on the side of the house and had my flashlight out shining it into a dark corner of the house. Right then, a bright flash from above caught my attention. The strange thing was that I only saw the flash with my left eye as if something was trying to get my attention, although nothing lit up around me. Another strange occurrence was that I knew to look straight up into the sky. The light caused the hairs on the back of my neck to instantly rise up.

I stopped and looked straight up to see a round bright ball of light above me. After looking at it for about 30 seconds it disappeared, then moved to the right and lit up again. It was moving slow and methodical. It was going way to slow to be a falling star or satellite. 

As I watched this thing move, it was as if I was trying to talk myself out of what I was witnessing. When it would reappear it looked as if it was falling a bit and then would stop. I served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where I have witnessed flares, and this was not a flare, but when it would appear it looked like it was falling like a flair, then would stop, stay still then go dark and move to the northeast. 

During the entire time of watching it, I tried to convenience myself that it was something I could explain, until I watched it do something very peculiar.

After observing the object for about 5 minutes while it moved slowly to the Northeast towards Fountain Hills, it did a button hook maneuver to the left and headed in the opposite direction of travel. Almost instantly after the button hook, it conducted another 180 degree turn just as fast and headed towards the Northeast again. I watch it for about another 2 minutes and then it disappeared.

It was something I could not explain. 

To remind you this was the area of the famous Phoenix lights. Camelback Mountain was a prime observation point for people here in the Valley that witnessed the Phoenix lights. Im convinced that I witnessed a UFO from another world, or some sort of secret government aircraft.

After observing approximately 25 UFO sightings during the past 12 months in and around the Westlake, Louisiana area; I am somewhat reluctant to file the attached report which I consider the least of all the aforementioned sightings. However, the sightings around here seem to be tapering off a bit as I have not had any in the months of April or May, so out of boredom from a lack of activity, I submit this report.

On the evening of June 5, 2009 at 9:00 PM, I stepped outside my house to scan the sky before retiring for the evening. The sky was extremely clear and all the stars were visible although somewhat dim due a nearly full moon.

After slowly doing a 360 degree scan of the sky three times without seeing anything remarkable, I started walking toward my front door when I noticed an object lit up in the Western sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.

The object can best be described as appearing somewhat like a very bright planet Venus, except it was approximately four times larger. The object appeared to just appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as it was headed North. The object was brightly illuminated for two seconds and would then quickly dim completely out of sight for 10-15 seconds and then reappear brightly for two more seconds. This sequence was repeated three times. Each time the object traveled approximately 20 degrees across the sky before it lit back up after 10-15 seconds.

There was absolutely no noise at all outside during the entire 50 seconds or so of elapsed time of this sighting.

I do not believe this sighting to be a normal aircraft due to a total silence during the time of the sighting, a lack of strobes and directional markers, and the relative size would be much larger than a jetliner at cruising altitude. Also, the speed of the object would have been much faster than a conventional aircraft. I also dismiss the notion of this being a satellite, as it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have witnessed before. Besides, I have never seen satellites turn on and off before either.

After making dinner I walked my dog before getting ready for bed. I live near the intercoastal so I always am looking into the sky around this time. However, when I walked outside I stopped at stared at a bright white star in the sky but to low to be a star. Im not sure how long it was there, but when i looked at it, it then shot straight down at light speeds and disappeared in mid air. There was also a stranger in the parking lot on his cell phone. He hung up and we both said, ""What the **** was that?!"" We both stared in shock. The circular white ball formed into two white balls and looked like a division symbol in the sky. It had one large dot then a line in the middle and then another dot directly behind the other as it shot towards earth. However, it looked like it would have landed close to the intercoastal waters or around the area where that scientology church is located in clearwater. This thing went directly down and had no trail whatsoever, so we ruled out a comet. I am young, in great health and have no vision problems and do not follow scientology or science fiction. This is one of the oddest things ive seen and has inspired me to do some online research like this.. But what was odd was that, whatever it was, it looked like it would have hit somewhere very close to that scientology building.

Sighting Report:  It was a Wednessday, May 25th or May 18th, 2005
approximately 5 or 6pm. We were driving on 183 back to Dallas from
Fort Worth. The sky was clear, blue with few white clouds.

I noticed a metalic sphere in the distant and my first thought was
it may be a UFO however the object did not move.  From the distance
I was at I would imagine something like an orange would cover up the
object from view at arms length.

I was trying to determine whether it was suspended in air or
attached to something, possibly a satellite dish or something like
that. However the object was clearly sphere shaped with nothing
sticking out of it or anything like that.

The next thing I thought of was possibly one of those balls you see
on telephone lines. I could not see any telephone lines to support
this theory. At this point I drove around towards the object but my
view was obstructed by trees and buildings as I turned onto a road
that looked as though it would take me closer. When my sight was no
longer obstructed I could not see the object anymore.

I did not report it because it wasn t ""flying"". It was either
hovering or suspended by something so I thought it was man made. But
the sighting has been bothering me for the past few weeks and I was
intruiged to find out if there were any reports around that time of
the same object.

While in my backyard looking to observe fireworks in the sky my attention was drawn to a bright orange orb. It was at first assumed to be a plane as I am located in a direct path of commercial planes heading for sky harbor airport. The brilliant orange light emission is what kept my attention on the object. It made no sound and moved at a seemingly slow but steady speed. It appeared from the east and took a path heading north west.

After 10 seconds of viewing the object and ruling out the possiblilty of it being a conventional craft I called for my daughter from the living room to come and verify what I was seeing. As soon as she came out I pointed at the object and asked her what color she was seeing. She confirmed that it was orange. She asked me what it was and I dismissed her question and asked her to go and fetch her mother. In a panic I also asked her to bring my phone which I later realized was in my pocket. While she summoned her mother I snapped one picture of the object but realized that the flash was on and the photo was probably not going to show anything since it was quite dark in the sky. As my wife was stepping out to see what the fuss was I turned off the flash on my phones camera and snapped another photo dissappointed because at this time the object was much further away than before. 

My wife also attempted to capture a picture of the object but by this time it was simply a small light in the very distant sky. I kept my eyes on the object until it eventually dissappered into the sky as it moved on a north western path further and further away.

After much backyard discussion and conjecture on what we all just witnessed I ran into the house and scanned through the news channels to see if there was any coverage on the event. Nothing. I sent the photos from my phone to my email account and played around with the zoom to see if there was any compelling evidence that what we saw was explainable.
The pictures are not very good to that end but what is very starnge to me is that the first picture I took with the flash on appears to be a picture taken in the daytime. You cannot tell at all that it was night. I know nothing about photography but this is very odd. You can even see clouds.

Appeared to be coming from a black spot in the sky approx 200ft in the air (no trees by the river in the area we were). As it travled the 3 of us looked up through our rifle scopes and could only see a black spot, but we could tell something was there as the stars were blacked out. We watched the light on the river sweeping from side to side, move towards us, past us, until it was approx 300 ft. down river, then the light went off and we could not see any sign of anything at all. We heard no noise even when the light was shining on the river directly infront of our campsite. Another thing we noticed was at the time we heard no frogs, or other noises, just dead quiet other than the river flowing. About an hour later we noticed the frogs again started making their regular noises. We only saw the circle of light on the river, and the black object (could not tell the size or shape just that the stars did not shine where it was) in the sky, we never saw a beam coming from the oject down to where the circular light was on the river.

Well this time what I can only describe as a disc with three sets of triple lights in triangle arrangement flew overhead in zig-zag pattern. The changes in direction were quite sharp without any apparent slowdown or difficulty. 

I watched surprised but calmly as it did this a few times. It was moving exceptionally quick, and it was high enough in the sky to be clear above any buildings, several hundred feet I would estimate, but it looked lower than most planes. 

Anyway it did this dance for a few more zigs and zags before abruptly halting its forward direction and traveling straight upwards out of view.

The light looked as if it was many miles away and somewhat high in the sky. It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time. As I watched the light it suddenly became 4-10 times larger then its initial size in less then a second. A few seconds later the light returned to its original size and as I was grabbing my video camera I looked up and it was gone. This all took place over a period of about 10 seconds.

I've been seeing Orb-like UFO's nearly every night ever since I purchased a 200mW green laser from an online source. It started about one year ago when I received my laser in the mail. I was showing the kids how to play with the cats and how it looks like a star wars light saber. We went outside to shine it in the sky at around 8:00 PM. The moon was out and my older son asked me if the laser would shine to the moon which was towards the west, so I shined it to the moon. Then he asked me to shine it at a star so I shined it at a star which was towards the east. Then I began to playfully shine it at the ground studying the effect of the beam because it was new to me and I never used a laser before. Then out of nowhere my son (who is 8 years old) yells out ""Dad! What is that""?! I turned to look up to see what he was looking at. There in the sky, was a very slow moving extremely bright white light just above the tree line. It was moving from north to south and crossed EXACTLY over the path of where I had just directed a laser beam at the moon. When I realized this I turned to see If something might be In the path of the other beam that I directed towards the star and behold, there was another one moving the same direction, parallel, and at the same rate of speed (Very Slow, almost a hover). Well, I became so frightened that I yelled to the kids to get in the house. My two sons and I ran swiftly to the door, and as I got the kids in the house I turned and watched the two craft join up/ meet together just above the tree line and wink off as if they had their hands on a dimmer switch or something. Gone! Ever since that night, nearly every night, I have been seeing, with the unaided-eye, bright balls/ orbs of light at all altitudes, intensity, speeds and quantity ranging from tree-line to edge of the atmosphere coming and going in every direction. On several occasion the ""craft"" appeared or materialized PRECISELY where I aimed my laser beam. It stopped/ hovered and gradually got so bright that I thought it was shooting straight at me, then suddenly disappeared. On other occasions I witnessed unusual, inconsistent, extremely bright, bi-location strobing of two ""craft"" perfectly synchronized. I'v seen twice now ""unusual"" meteor-like objects that do not fall, but rise at a gradual angle and zip by at a perfectly parallel trajectory with the ground. One of these incidences originated from the Strobe-like ""craft"". Finally, I have been experiencing episodes of sleep paralysis which is quite terrifying. When I'm outside, I seem to be able to ""feel"" when one of these ""craft"" are near and/ or visible. Until this past year, I was never afraid of anything except for maybe nuclear war. Since I was a young boy I would always go camping, biking and hiking alone until last year. Now I only go within arms reach of the front door to see the very thing that frightens me the most.

I live in independence and was looking west towards KC which this bright star light sphere seemed to be South of KC. It was brighter than all the stars showing and even brighter than Venus which was to the lower right. It seemed to have a beam of light shooting out of it like a rotating light house which slowly came down as it was turning. As the beam of light rotated around and slowly came down to my angle it was slowing in rotation and seemed to stop... pointing at me as if it knew i was looking at it. It was very far away so i wasn't too concerned. 

I had my dogs with me and they started acting excited and it was time to go anyways. I got home and went in looking through the window and it seemed to have changed position. 

I then got onto my computer and looked up an astronomy program and found that it could have been the star Aldebaran which sort of made me feel better but I've never seen a star do this. I recall something from my childhood which ! makes me feel leery of these type of strange occurrences.

Large object above thousands... and only a few reacted.

I was with my buds in Ybor, when I noticed a large craft hovering above us. Everyone saw it some even pointed at it. But no one else was the least bit surprised by it. It had an inscription on the side as it hovered by... it took me a very long time to read it but it turned out it was english! As it hovered just a few hundred feet above our heads I could make out ""Good..."" then as my eyes focused ""..Year"". It said ""GoodYear"" on it. I peered deeper into the craft and could make out a small figure inside running the entire craft. How it was able to hover just above our head without wings, I do not know. It was almost like it could fall at anytime. I ran into a near by bar to tell everyone there, they were all excited and rushed out. But the second they laid eyes on it they threw their arms down and went back to drinking. There was a flashing light on the bottom of it. I knew that had to be the reason for everyones immeadiate dismissal of the craft. I don't know why it wasnt working on me, but every single person I went to looked at it, and almost instantaneous laughed or giggled and paid no more attention to it. Theses ufo's are getting more sophisticated. It was almost like everyone had seen it a thousand times... could it be that since we are having more and more encounters that the extraterrestials have resorted to mind control? I'm not sure it was the flashing light, perhaps it was the script on the side of the vessel, perhaps the combination of the words ""Good"" and ""Year"" are some type of code words that allow extraterrestials to bypass our natural instinct of fear! Again I am not sure as to way these words had no effect to me, but it could all go back to the creations of man, maybe we're some type of hybrid monkey that the extraterrestials used as slaves and as we developed we became more modernized and fearful so they had to implant genes into our gene pool to assure us as potential slaves for future use just in case their newly appointed slaves arent as useful as we once were.

The object seemed to slightly change in flight direction, it appeared to slowly drift from S to SW and back again a few times.

The lights were of a thin rectangular formation, six lights on the perimeter with a brighter light in the center. After watching the lights I realized it was moving across the sky.

I cannot fill out most of the blanks above because the object I am about to describe was found in a photo-album around the early 1940's.
I was looking through the album roughly 1 weeks ago around first week in dec, 2020 when I came across this picture in one of the pages.
Someone in our family took a picture of the family pet (dog) in the back yard. The picture shows most of the back side of the house, the patio, and the dog. It also shows the backside of the house roof. Whoever took the picture also got the roof top, chimney and sky in the background. A little to the right of the chimney there is what looks like a UFO hovering above the chimney stack. 
The picture is in black and white and a laminate is covering the picture. There are no wrinkles in the picture.
Obviously whoever took the picture did not catch the hovering object. Nothing was mentioned of this apparition all these years which is almost 80 years old.. 
The area that this picture was taken looks like a typical residential setting.

This house was my dad's parents house in the Redwood City/Palto Alto area of California.
As far as I know, nobody ever said anything about this picture or was it ever mentioned that I know of.
If this is an actual picture or not I think that it should interest people in the UFO community simply because if is roughly five to seven years before Roswell.
If you are interested in a picture of this, I will need your phone #. My wife will take a picture of the actual photograph on her cell phone.

In the summer of 2008 (May-June), when I was 12. My mom, my cousin brother and I were hiking in the Himalayas in the state of Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand). We were camping in a very small village by the name of Â« Duggalbitta Â», Chopta. We were settling in a tent on the mountainside, away from the former British resort and the shops. We werenât very far, just a short walk away. 

We were lying on the ground, it was night time, mustâve been anywhere from 10-10:30 PM. It was a partially cloudy, but clear other than the clouds, and you could see mountains by the moonlight and the starlight. The sky was full of stars. We were camped at about 8,000 feet or 2,438.4 metres. 
When suddenly something caught my eye in the sky. A star, or what seemed to be a star was moving erratically back and forth, I thought that I was hallucinating (and I was going to exclude this account, but I didnât when your list mentioned that autokinesis and autostasis happen during an inky-black sky not during a starry one). But there it was oscillating back and forth. I mentioned this to my mom, and my cousin, at first they didnât see it, but then they did as well. They assumed that it was a satellite or a meteor. I thought that it was a UFO, because the Â« The History Â» channelâs Â« Ancient Aliens Â» program made me think so. This event lasted for about 5-10 minutes, and I tried to film it, but my camera was really old and decrepit. And unfortunately this event passed without filming.

I had a fear that aliens would come into my tent and abduct me because of those programs that I saw, but thankfully nothing of the sort happened, and I woke up the next day, ready for our hike.",IN,

I said to myself I've never seen green lights on an aircraft before. (not saying it's not aloud, just strange to me). Then I started to drive slow, with my window down to get a better look. It didn't have any sound or noise coming from the aircraft. It began to move, change direction in a weird way. That's when i knew it wasn't a helicopter by the way it was flying and how the lights were flashing and look. I took my phone out and began recording it. Other people that were driving their cars noticed it as well by the way they were hitting the break. I turned on a road not far from my house. Stop the car and kept recording it. I began to drive again, as i was driving the aircraft started flying in the direction I was going. I thought it was following me. I got a little nervous and stop recording and picked up speed to get home. As I was telling my fiance what I saw I was getting the video ready to show her. My phone only recorded 1 second of footage, but the file size of the video was 13MB.

My friend and I were driving to the Quakerbridge mall in my sisters Datsun 280zx on RT. I-95 going east. My sisters car has a moon roof. I was gazing out through the moon roof noticing the slight fog in the air as I was driving and noticed two lighted objects appear side by side. It looked as if they were coming towards us but being that we were driving in that direction probably made it look that way. I quickly called to my friend and told him to look up, do you see what I see? he said yes, what is it? One of the objects hovered above us and followed in our direction as the other one had seemed to stay behind. I immediately noticed the shape and lights. There were what seemd to be four octagon pods hooked together with a honey comb shape screen or lens and the lights slowly pulsated in each pod, white, red, blue and maybe orange?? Driving at 60mph I slowed down and pulled the car over to the side of the road so we could get out to get a better look at the object. As we looked up into the foggy air, we could not see the object. We got back in the car and drove on to the next exit ( Trenton, New Brunswick ) As we took the New brunswick exit toward the mall, we had to stop at the next red traffic light. The New Jersey motor vehicles inspection station is on the right. As we were waiting for the light to turn green, I looked up into the fog and there it was, right above us, that same pulsating octagon object. I jestured for my friend to look up and we watched it slowly ascend into the foggy air and then nothing, it was gone. The light turned green and we went on our way asking each other what the hell did we just see? The strange thing about this experience was that it did not creep us out or make us scared. It was like, oh whats that? and then hmmm, life goes on. I do have to say I have always been intrigued by stories of UFO's ever since i was eleven years old. I loved watching old saucer movies and reading books on the subject, but never would I have imagined that oneday I would get to w! itness o ne?? I am now a deffinet believer in UFO's.

I was washing some dishes when I noticed something out of the window. It caught the corner of my eye, I looked and saw a dark, non-reflective object in the sky. At first, I thought it was a balloon but it was flying/floating sideways not up. I took a closer look and saw that it was black, non-reflective, roughly egg-shaped and changing shape as it moved. I ran to the living room to get a clearer view and noticed that it did not have wings, vertical stabilizer, rudder, noticeable cockpit, etc... It did not look like a plane/jet in any way. I live on the 13th floor of a 21 story building on a hilltop overlooking a good portion of the city. Looking out of the window which faces W/NW (290), it approached from the right (330)and flew to about S/SW (210) before turning sharply to what I can only guess would be West. It continued till it disappeared from sight. That is NOT a regular flightpath. The airports would have been to the left (East).It roughly had a Southerly Flightpath.

I will even go on a limb and say that it absorbed light, I couldn't see any features at all except that it was there.

My father and I read in the newspaper about a Japanese named comet visible from around 10-11 pm-the tail progressively lengthening as the head neared the horizon of the ocean at Virginia Beach,it met the sun rising.My father came home from work around 10(he owned a restaurant/tavern) and said ""let's go,we're going to see the comet."" I was 11 or 12 at the time,he was 42.This happened over 35 years ago.

First,none of us were on anything.We drove to the beach and parked in the tourist parking lot next to the statue of the Norweigan lady.If you've been to Va Beach you know what I'm talking about.We walked across the boardwalk,a few folks walking by,we walked down the stairs and hit the sandy beach.At this hour the beach almost vacant.We saw 3-4 stragglers and a guy surf casting.We could barely make out the comet.The fisherman cranked in his line and left.The wind barely blowing,calm,the ocean almost like glass.Soon the beach emptied and around midnight even the boardwalk emptied.We were standing on the beach alone.The comet grew in length and brightness and my father remarked we needed to move further north up by Cape Henry to lose the lights of the boardwalk.I reckon it was 1 AM.The lights were shining a good 50 to 100 feet out into the ocean a ways past calm surf.All of a sudden I saw a movement to the north came down from the sky,an object angling down and towards us.It was a flying saucer as clear as could be seen lit up in detail by the bright lights glowing off the boardwalk.The saucer was about 40 feet across and metallic grey but not shiny.

It then veered out straight and leveled out less than 10 feet over the waves and continued past us no more than 30 feet eyeball to eyeball in front of us,kind of wavered a bit,I estimate the domed saucer was streaking by at 100 miles an hour,Zip! to the south towards the Virginia Beach fishing pier and about 30 feet to our right,kind of wavered up and out to sea,rose into the dark sky out of the shining boardwalk lights now masking our view of it's climb away.I wanted the dome to be lit up and looked as quickly as i could for objects in the dome and saw nothing.

It was dark in there.

We were looking right at it,our heads twisting like at a tennis tournament.I said ""did you see that?"" and my father asked the exact same thing ""did you see that?"" We both acknowledged each other that we had.So I was not dreaming (hallucinating it) nor was he.I said ""it was a flying saucer!"" and he repeated the same thing.We were very excited and the Japanese comet took an abrupt back seat.Now I have read about strange lights way up in the sky and objects and I understand why they are called UFO's but this was like wilderness camping and having Big Foot come over and take a steak off the grill.I mean this was not a UFO,this was a flying saucer.I do not remember the exact year I was 12 or so but it was mid-60's.Oceana Naval airstation you might say but I am a very logical person and no way back then they would have a flying domed saucer object come from Oceana and not be heard at some point.Their jets are loud,still are.

I am about to describe to this day is what we saw may be deemed as unidentified.This puzzles me and will until I die.

The object was absolutely silent.Nothing.The waves were not crashing to drown out anything,it was quiet at 1 AM then in Virginia Beach,only a car or two going by every minute or so.What could have propelled an object at 100 miles an hour silently? It shot past us and we felt no air current off it and we saw no ripple on the ocean from it's passing.As it was climbing away from us,no noise at all.Nothing, like we were deaf.How's this possible? We stared up for lights,propulsion,anything.We saw no more,heard no more.

I can only say it was like we were seeing it in a dream but we were wide awake and backed each other up what we had just seen only feet away lit up.In my mind I can see it as clear as the night we saw it.My father is now 79 years old and we talk about it every once in a while.We were very lucky to be standing at the right place at the right time.We eventually moved down the beach to the north into darkness and watched the comet's crash into the horizon of the ocean as the sun rose.

It was an eventful night.

We were traveling eastbound on Texas Highway 64 from Canton to Tyler. Passing through Ben Wheeler (26 miles West of Tyler), we observed a sphere shaped object at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet traveling westbound. This object appeared to be 1.5 miles South of the Highway, traveling parallel to it and was solid gray in color. At no time were we able to see through it.

For 25 minutes, we had a visual on the object, with the only lapses being caused by us driving through wooded areas which would block our view for a few seconds.

After 25 minutes, the object appeared to change to a more elongated form, with the aft section beginning to droop. At this time, we started noticing more detail. We would estimate the length to be 300-400 yards in total. At the top portion, there appeared to be an object protruding out. The protrusion was black and gave the general appearance of a small fixed wing aircraft in a gentle climb. The middle of was still gray, and the drooping section appeared silver in color.

At this point, we lost visual and sped up to try to get through the tree lined area. We pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot, and began to scan the skyline. We had lost visual for 3-5 minutes while clearing the trees and pulling into the parking lot. We never regained visual.
